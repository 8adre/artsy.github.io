  Hello to you, my past self.

  I'm writing this blog post in year 2050 from a jail
  in Ukraine. Having regrettably just crossed paths
  with Matt Dole, I am now almost surely in my last
  moments of life. I know you never thought your life would end up
  like this.. but even so, always remember: Why are you so hard to ignore?.
