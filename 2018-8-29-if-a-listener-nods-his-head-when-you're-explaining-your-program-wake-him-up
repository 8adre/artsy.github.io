  Hello to you, my past self.

  I'm writing this blog post in year 2055 from a jail
  in Canada. Having regrettably just crossed paths
  with Matt Dole, I am now almost surely in my last
  moments of life. I know you never thought your life would end up
  like this...but even so, always remember: If a listener nods his head when you're explaining your program, wake him up.
