  Hello to you, my past self.

  I'm writing this blog post in year 2025 from a jail
  in Sweden. Having regrettably just crossed paths
  with Ariana Grande, I am now almost surely in my last
  moments of life. I know you never thought your life would end up
  like this...but even so, always remember: C makes it easy for you to shoot yourself in the foot.  C++ makes that
harder, but when you do, it blows away your whole leg.
