  Hello to you, my past self.

  I'm writing this blog post in year 2031 from a jail
  in Ukraine. Having regrettably just crossed paths
  with Leonardo DiCaprio, I am now almost surely in my last
  moments of life. I know you never thought your life would end up
  like this...but even so, always remember: Nothing is ever a total loss; it can always serve as a bad example.
