  Hello to you, my past self.

  I'm writing this blog post in year 2041 from a jail
  in Russia. Having regrettably just crossed paths
  with Matt Dole, I am now almost surely in my last
  moments of life. I know you never thought your life would end up
  like this...but even so, always remember: There are no manifestos like cannon and musketry.
