    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>One of the defining cultural features of the Artsy Engineering team is that we strive to be Open Source by Default.
This didn't happen over-night and was a multi-year effort from many people to push Artsy's engineering culture to
the point where it was acceptable and living up to the ideals still requires on-going effort today.</p>

<p>I think to understand this, we need to dive into the archives of some of member's older posts to grok their
intentions and ideas. Yes, this is a re-cap episode. Let's go.</p>

<a name="What.is..Open.Source.by.Default.."></a>
<h1>What is "Open Source by Default"?</h1>

<p>In short, it's the idea that working in the open should be your starting position for a new project and when
creating a new project you need to argue the value of closing the project instead. This turns into an axiom which
powers quite a lot of the <a href="https://github.com/artsy/README/blob/master/culture/engineering-principles.md#engineering-principles">Engineering Principles</a> which Artsy holds dear.</p>

<p>In 2015, as we were nearing working entirely in the open - our CTO at the time, <a href="https://code.dblock.org">dB.</a> wrote what became our
Open Source by Default north-star:</p>

<blockquote><p>When starting a new service, library or application I am going to default to open. I am going to weigh whether
there’s any advantage of keeping a project closed-source, knowing and presuming that there’re numerous
disadvantages.</p>

<p>Team heads, including myself, are making open-source their foundation. This means building non-core intellectual
property components as open source. That’s easily 2/3 of the code you write and we all want to focus on our core
competencies. Hence open-source is a better way to develop software, it’s like working for a company of the size
of Microsoft, without the centralized bureaucracy and true competition.</p>

<p>By default, I contribute to other people’s generic open-source solutions to save time and money by not
reinventing the wheel. Taking this further, I spend significant amount of time extracting non-domain-specific
code into new or existing open-source libraries, reducing the footprint of the proprietary applications I work
on.</p></blockquote>

<a name="How.Did.We.Get.There."></a>
<h1>How Did We Get There?</h1>

<p>In 2011 Artsy hired <a href="https://code.dblock.org">dB.</a> to be our Head of Engineering, You can get a sense of his frustration in trying to do
Open Source work in prior companies via a post from 2010 on opensource.com.</p>

<blockquote><p>Armed with a healthy dose of idealism, I went to executive management and proposed we open source the tool. I was
hoping for a no-brainer and a quick decision at the division level. To my surprise, it took two years, a vast
amount of bureaucracy, and far more effort than I ever anticipated.</p></blockquote>

<p>→ <a href="https://opensource.com/life/10/12/corporate-change-contributing-open-source">Corporate change: Contributing to open source</a></p>

<p>In contrast today, in the culture he set up for Artsy Engineering - you actually have a (<a href="https://github.com/artsy/README/issues/131">tiny!</a>) bit more
bureaucracy if you wanted to create a new <em>closed</em> source project than an open source one.</p>

<a name="L2011.-.First.steps"></a>
<h2>2011 - First steps</h2>

<p>Towards the end of 2011, Artsy's first step into contributing to open source was via a project called <a href="https://github.com/sarcilav/heroku-bartender">Heroku
Bartender</a> (dB. has a <a href="https://code.dblock.org/2011/03/20/continuous-deployment-with-heroku-bartender.html">write up on it</a>).</p>

<p>Artsy is lucky because both of our co-founders have a technical background (<a href="https://www.forbes.com/special-report/2014/30-under-30/art-and-style.html">computer science at
Princeton</a>, and <a href="https://www.technyc.org/leadership-council/sebastian-cwilich">AT&amp;T Labs</a>) because our CEO then sent a team email which really hammered the internal
value of writing OSS and letting people know it exists:</p>

<blockquote><p>"Team, The Engineering team just open sourced an awesome tool called Heroku-Bartender. It was mentioned on Hacker
News with a link to its GitHub repository. It made it into the top posts. I want everyone to check it out and
read through the comments. Open source is a great way for us to establish engineering credibility while
contributing to the community-at-large. -Thank you and congratulations to Engineering."</p></blockquote>

<p>dB. reflects on how different the mentality for open source is different in a modern startup in contrast to
existing large corporations.</p>

<blockquote><p>My CEO has made giving back to the community and building karma part of our company culture. Investors look for
this because it attracts those top engineers who will ultimately execute the company’s vision. Open source is no
longer the way of the future—it is the way the new CEOs are wired.</p>

<p>The companies that don’t embrace these open movements will simply fail, because the culture of secrecy and fear
is a thing of the past.</p></blockquote>

<a name="L2012.-.Open.Communications"></a>
<h2>2012 - Open Communications</h2>

<p>While Artsy started to ship a lot more libraries in 2012, probably the most important step we took during this
first year was creating this blog, and publishing 33 (<a href="/blog/archives/">!</a>) blog posts by 8 authors (close to the entire
team!).</p>

<p>This really helped established a baseline that external communications could be a foundation of openness, it might
not yet be code, but blog posts are an awesome start. I know my first blog during this time was specifically built
because I had solved a hard problem which I expected others would have. My answer wasn't generic enough to warrant
making a library but it was big enough to write a <a href="/blog/2012/05/11/on-making-it-personal--in-iOS-with-searchbars/">blog post sharing the code</a> and providing context.</p>

<p>We structured write-ups as being an important part of our work, and dB. as Head of Engineering started leading by
example by shipping about 2/3rds of our posts. Writing this many blog posts in our first year of creating a blog is
a pretty solid achievement in my opinion, and the blog has always represented Artsy's Engineering team in one way
or another:</p>

<blockquote><p>I consider our blog, and the rest of the site, to be the canonical representation of the Artsy Engineering team
online. We've carefully grown an Artsy Engineering aesthetic around it.</p></blockquote>

<p>→ <a href="/blog/2019/01/30/why-we-run-our-blog/">Why We Run Our Own Blog</a></p>

<p>Getting people into a space where they feel like contributions to this blog are not <em>big deals</em> but are <em>iterative
improvements</em> was step one towards OSS by Default.</p>

<blockquote><p>A commit says the what, a pull request the how and a blog post gives the why. Writing about our code allows us to
provide documentation for future employees with the context around how decisions were made. Nobody <em>wants</em> to
ship messy code, but a lot of the time you choose to in order to provide something positive.</p></blockquote>

<p>That said, the team wasn't sitting on our hands in terms of making shared infrastructure, we built libraries within
the Ruby and iOS communities: <a href="https://github.com/orta/ARAnalytics">ARAnalytics</a>,

<p>Some of which we still use today.</p>

<a name="L2013.-.Tools..amp..Libraries"></a>
<h2>2013 - Tools &amp; Libraries</h2>

<p>In 2013 Artsy took its first steps towards separating our front-ends from our back-ends. From a perspective of OSS
by Default this lowers the barriers a lot. We have been conservative with opening the source code for back-end
services, as they tended to contain more valuable business infrastructure.</p>

<p>As the web team explored building websites in Node, we took opportunities to use marketing websites like
<a href="https://iphone.artsy.net">iphone.artsy.net</a> (<a href="https://github.com/artsy/flare">flare</a>) and <a href="https://2013.artsy.net">2013.artsy.net</a>
(<a href="https://github.com/artsy/artsy-2013">artsy-2013</a>) to explore building a website in the open. These projects were
small, self contained and well scoped. I wasn't involved in the decision to make them open, but I'm pretty sure it
went something like <em>"Should this be private? Nah. Ok."</em> A single page web-app wasn't a risk.</p>

<p>The team also started exploring working on some more fundamental OSS infrastructure, we built out a framework for
building Node apps called <a href="/blog/2013/11/30/rendering-on-the-server-and-client-in-node-dot-js/">Ezel</a> (which we still use today <a href="/blog/2017/09/05/Modernizing-Force/">in Force</a>) and started work to
co-maintain CocoaPods and CocoaDocs.</p>

<a name="L2014.-.New.Apps"></a>
<h2>2014 - New Apps</h2>

<a name="artsy.net"></a>
<h3>artsy.net</h3>

<p>In 2014 we <a href="/blog/2014/09/05/we-open-sourced-our-isomorphic-javascript-website/">open-sourced the Artsy website</a>. This was a major step forward in OSS by Default, we played
it safe by having the open source aspect as being a public fork that engineers would push changes to. This meant
that GitHub issues and Pull Request discussion could happen in private. It was a good, safe, incremental step. We
took an application which was very dear to us, and found a way to reduce the risk in moving to be open.</p>

<p>We could move our main website to be open source because we had successfully shipped prior art. The problems were
more or less the same, just at a larger scale. We had to worry about leaking secrets in code and commits, but those
best practices we had baked into the website from its inception 10 months prior.</p>

<a name="Editorial.CMS..amp..Bidding.Kiosk"></a>
<h3>Editorial CMS &amp; Bidding Kiosk</h3>

<p>We scoped out building a <a href="https://github.com/artsy/positron">new CMS</a> for our editorial team, this new app started as open source from day one.</p>

<p>This step inspired the iOS team who were also exploring trying to move to be more open in their work. By this point
we had two large private iOS apps, but had the need for a new iOS app for covering bidding at auctions on-site.</p>

<blockquote><p>Orta and I met some friends over a weekend in Austria and, during our drive across the country, discussed the
possibility of developing this new iOS app as a completely open source project. We were both excited about the
prospect and had the support from dB. to make it open.</p></blockquote>

<p>→ <a href="https://artsy.github.io/blog/2014/11/13/eidolon-retrospective/">Developing a Bidding Kiosk for iOS in Swift</a></p>

<p>We built out some necessary community infrastructure for iOS apps to be built in the open, and worked exclusively
in the open on this project. Working in the open on the bidding kiosk proved to be very useful when communicating
with others about hard problems we were seeing with new tooling, as well as providing reference implementations for
community ideas.</p>

<a name="L2015.-.Backtracking.to.move.iOS.to.OSS.by.Default"></a>
<h2>2015 - Backtracking to move iOS to OSS by Default</h2>

<p>We were really starting to see what OSS by Default looks like by 2015. You can feel it in dB's and the mobile
team's writing:</p>

<blockquote><p>First, I recognize that becoming open-source by default is emotionally, organizationally and, sometimes,
technically hard. As such, this post is not a manifesto, it’s a step in the right direction that will guide my
career and technology choices in the future.</p>

<p>When starting a new service, library or application I am going to default to open. I am going to weigh whether
there’s any advantage of keeping a project closed-source, knowing and presuming that there’re numerous
disadvantage</p>

<p>I am going to default to the MIT License for all new projects, because it’s short and clear and protects everyone
[...]</p>

<p>Despite overwhelming evidence, many non-technical people are worried about risks surrounding open-source. I am
convinced that any business success depends a lot more on your ability to serve customers and partners, the brand
and culture and the commitment to hiring the best of the best in all fields, than on the hypothetical risks that
a competitor might gain by taking advantage of your open-source software.</p></blockquote>

<p>→ <a href="https://code.dblock.org/2015/02/09/becoming-open-source-by-default.html">Becoming Open Source by Default</a></p>

<blockquote><p>The Artsy mobile team is small, especially in contrast to the other teams in this issue of objc.io. Despite this,
we’re notable for our impact on the community. Members of our iOS development team are — and have been — involved
in almost all major open-source projects in the Cocoa community.</p>

<p>At the start of 2015, we finished open sourcing the Artsy iOS app, eigen. This is a process that took many
months; we needed to take considered, incremental steps both to prove that there was business value in open
sourcing our consumer-facing app, and to disprove any concerns around letting others see how the sausage is made.</p>

<p>Earlier, we said that being open source by default means that everything stays open unless there is a good reason
to keep it secret. The code we do share isn’t what makes Artsy unique or valuable. There is code at Artsy that
will necessarily stay closed forever.</p>

<p>Working in the open isn’t so different from typical software development. We open issues, submit pull requests,
and communicate over GitHub. When we see an opportunity to create a new library, the developer responsible for
that library creates it under his or her own GitHub account, not Artsy’s.</p>

<p>People often ask why we operate in the open as we do. We’ve already discussed our technical motivations, as well
as the sense of purpose it gives individual team members, but honestly, working in the open is just smart
business.</p></blockquote>

<p>→ <a href="https://www.objc.io/issues/22-scale/artsy/">iOS at Scale: Artsy</a></p>

<p>2015 was the year where the mobile team went back and open-sourced our previous iOS apps. We had two of them, we
started with the app the team worked on daily: Artsy for iOS (Eigen). We opened the repo in january, and had a
write-up on the process and changes needed to make it work a few months later once the dust has settled.</p>

<blockquote><p>Credit where credit is due, when we were working on Eidolon [the Bidding Kiosk], our CTO dB. just casually tossed
the idea that, really, Eigen should be open source too.</p>

<p>We devoted time at the end of 2014 to understand what the constraints were for getting the app opened. [...] We
opted to go for a total repo switch, removing all history. There were a lot of places where keys could have been
hiding within the app.</p>

<p>One of the things that we found a bit sad about the transition to a new repo, is that it's hard to give past
contributors recognition for their work.</p>

<p>It's one thing to think that it's possible, it's another to do it. I'm glad that I am in a position where I can
enact change. I felt no resistance in the process. I kept offering potential avenues for someone to stop me, too.
I emailed the entire team as I started the process 2 weeks before it happened, I talked to anyone who might write
issues or contribute from the design team. As I got further along the process and sent another email out that it
was going to happen tomorrow. All I got were 👍 and 🎉s in GIF form.</p></blockquote>

<p>→ <a href="https://artsy.github.io/blog/2015/04/28/how-we-open-sourced-eigen/">How we Open Source'd Eigen</a></p>

<p>Going through the process, and being certain in the trade-offs meant for the project gave the mobile team the
confidence to take the time to open source their oldest iOS project - a gallery portfolio tool, Folio.</p>

<blockquote><p>It's worth mentioning that we don't just talk externally about open source. Internally, the Mobile team runs
talks about open source for the rest of the Artsy staff. As well, we discuss the tooling and business
implications of having our work in public repos. Artsy strives for an open culture, in this case the development
team, on the whole, is just further along in the process.</p>

<p>The open Source app idea started with an experiment in the Summer of 2014, asking, "What does a truly open source
App look like?" The outcome of that was our Swift Kiosk app, Eidolon. Open from day one. We took the knowledge
from that and applied it to our public facing app, Eigen. Open from day 806. That made 2/3rds of our apps Open
Source. I'm going to talk about our final app, Energy. Open from day 1433 and ~3500 commits.</p>

<p>Folio is interesting in that it has competitors. To some extent the Kiosk app does too, but the cost of entry
there is really high in comparison. Folio on the other hand, has a handful of competing businesses who exist to
only build a Gallery/Museum/Collector portfolio app.</p>

<p>Energy, however, requires you have a Artsy partner account. So opening it up would mean that an OSS developer
hits the login screen and is stuck. In developing this app, I've slowly been creating my own partner gallery
account based on my paintings and photography. So now when you set up the app to be ran as an OSS app, it will
pre-load a known database of artworks and metadata from my test gallery.</p>

<p>Its easy to imagine that open sourcing something is an end-point, but from our perspective it is a journey. We
want to make sure that anyone can download this app, learn how and why it's structured and then run through the
app with a debugger to get a deeper sense of how everything connects. Just releasing the code would have been
underwhelming. Instead we're aiming high.</p></blockquote>

<p>→ <a href="https://artsy.github.io/blog/2015/08/06/open-sourcing-energy/">Open Sourcing Energy</a></p>

<p>This one is a good read, but extra worth the click because it includes an email I wrote to the entire of Artsy with
the intent of priming the company about opening the source code.</p>

<p>dB. and myself spent quite a lot of time talking to the rest of the company about the OSS ideals, our company's
values and open source fit. Here's <a href="https://vimeo.com/136554627">a 5m video</a> which is a great example of how we presented open source
internally:</p>

<blockquote><p>"Are there any advantages in keeping something closed? If there are no advantages, default to open."</p>

<p>"Instead of asking for permission, just communicate what you are doing and let other people suggest better ways
of doing it. Maybe sometimes a better way is closed."</p>

<p>"Artsy will stand behind your open source contributions as a team."</p>

<p>"Open Source will create more value, and it will positively impact our culture."</p></blockquote>

<a name="L2016.-.Web.OSS.by.Default"></a>
<h2>2016 - Web OSS by Default</h2>

<p>In 2016 we had really started to understand the differences in how we interact with the open source community:</p>

<blockquote><p>...and in over a year these expectations have been met. Some of our libraries have become big, and our apps have
received small feature PRs. We're pleasantly surprised when it happens, but we don't expect it.</p>

<p>I didn't expect to be told face to face how many people have read, and learned from our codebases. We get around
120 unique clones of our iOS apps every week. People tell us that it's where they found a certain technique, or
that they could see how the trade-offs were made for certain decisions.</p>

<p>I also under-estimated how useful open code is in encouraging a culture of writing.</p></blockquote>

<p>→ <a href="https://artsy.github.io/blog/2016/01/13/OSS-Expectations/">Open Source Expectations</a></p>

<p>Once we had proved that we could safely port our large, private iOS codebases to be public. That we could safely
work in the open on mobile project, we <a href="https://artsy.github.io/blog/2016/09/06/Milestone-on-OSS-by-Default/">brought that back to web</a>. We went back to take artsy.net from
being an open fork to working in the open:</p>

<blockquote><p>Though Force wasn't quite Open Source by Default, it represented a really important step for Artsy's OSS
perspective but was not the end goal. We were opening our source, but not opening our process.</p>

<p>... the web team started the process of opening our apps at Artsy, then the mobile team took the next big step.
Now the teams are both in lock-step, and if you work on the front-end at Artsy - OSS by Default is the way we all
work now.</p></blockquote>

<a name="L2017-2019.Moving.the.Platform.forward"></a>
<h2>2017-2019 Moving the Platform forward</h2>

<p>As a gross simplification, Artsy is split between back-end and front-end engineers. With most all of the
front-end as open (well, maybe 90%, which is <em>good enough</em>™️) then the only space for improvement towards Open
Source by Default was within the back-end. We call the collection of engineers with the skill-sets for building
APIs and shared infrastructure the Platform team.</p>

<p>Our platform teams have always had a weaker stance towards opening their codebases. Most of our APIs are almost
100% business logic, and there's a good reason for a lot of our APIs to be closed source. Though in the the last
two years though there's been movement towards writing new services in the open:</p>

<p><strong>2017</strong> - <a href="https://github.com/artsy/bearden">artsy/bearden</a> &amp; <a href="https://github.com/artsy/rsvp">artsy/rsvp</a></p>

<p><strong>2018</strong> - <a href="https://github.com/artsy/APR">artsy/APR</a>, <a href="https://github.com/artsy/exchange/">artsy/exchange</a> &amp;
<a href="https://github.com/artsy/kaws/">artsy/kaws</a></p>

<p><strong>2019</strong> - <a href="https://github.com/artsy/volley">artsy/volley</a></p>

<p>Which over the course of the last two years seems to be about half of the new systems we've built. This is great!
Examples of private tools are analytics parsers, GDPR infrastructure and machine learning services. These had good
reasons to be closed and <a href="https://github.com/artsy/README/issues/131">have documented rationales for being closed</a>.</p>

<a name="L2019."></a>
<h2>2019+</h2>

<p>However, asking where do we go from here is a pretty tricky question. Most of the code that would be opened is now
open, and the projects which could move into the public be are very reasonably contentious.</p>

<a name="Does.that.mean.we..strong.are..strong..Open.Source.by.Default."></a>
<h2>Does that mean we <strong>are</strong> Open Source by Default?</h2>

<p>For people that joined post-2016, it certainly feels like it. People who apply to Artsy cite Open Source by Default
as being a strong factor in their decisions.</p>

<p>I'm not too sure personally though, maybe only in the axiomatic sense. Artsy operate by the rule of open by
default, but it takes time and effort to do the extra work which is derived from that idea: e.g. improving our
community engagement.</p>

<p>That's Artsy's biggest space for cultural growth now.</p>

    <updated>2019-04-19T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
    <id>http://artsy.github.io/blog/2019/04/19/having-a-coffee-with-every-engineer</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>In early 2018, I was set to begin my fifth year working at Artsy. Something about my imminent Artsyversary had me
thinking about my role within the Engineering team. Not my role as an engineer <em>per se</em>, but my role as a
<em>colleague</em>. This is the longest I've ever worked for one company, and as Artsy started growing the team last year,
I wanted to <a href="https://github.com/artsy/README/blob/master/culture/engineering-principles.md#leverage-your-impact">leverage my impact</a> as a longtime colleague to help scale its culture.</p>

<p>Artsy collects quarterly, anonymous, company-wide surveys through <a href="https://www.cultureamp.com">Culture Amp</a> to determine how everyone is
doing. These are great for answering quantitative questions about the team, like "how engaged are we on average?",
and I always check out the breakdown of answers in the Engineering team. But there's something unsatisfying about
these reports – they're super-valuable, but they feel impersonal to me.</p>

<p>If I wanted to leverage my impact, I needed to play to my strengths and interests. I'm keenly interested in people
– as individuals – so I decided that the best way for me to contribute to the team was to get to know everyone as
individuals. To become someone the team could talk to. Someone outside the typical manager/employee structure, who
could use their history at Artsy to answer questions (or at least point them in the right direction).</p>

<p>So, I set off on a project to meet with every member of Artsy's Engineering team for a one-on-one. With no explicit
goals or expectations, but in line with Artsy's <a href="https://github.com/artsy/README/blob/master/culture/what-is-artsy.md#people-are-paramount">People are Paramount</a> value, I got to know my colleagues
better.</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>I didn't want this project to interfere with my product work, so I decided to take things slow. I started with a
list of every Artsy engineer and then removed anyone I already had a close working relationship with. Next, I
prioritized the team leads and randomized the rest of the list. I set up a recurring task (yay OmniFocus) to
schedule a coffee with an engineer every week. When we met, I'd cross them off my list.</p>

<p>That was over a year ago, so what did I learn? Well, a lot, actually! But to get a sense of the impact my project
had, you'll need some context.</p>

<p>2018 was a complex year for Artsy, where we both gained and lost more engineers than usual. The increase in
engineering turnover was generally attributable to what I'll call "cultural churn." Scaling a team comes with new
challenges, and our team leadership tried to meet those challenges with changes to the team's structure. Some of
these changes turned out to be tougher than we'd hoped. Our team is in a great spot <em>now</em>, but we didn't get from
there to here via a straight line.</p>

<p>In the midst of this cultural churn, I was trying to have a one-on-one with every engineer. I was asking
people "hey, how are you doing? Want to grab a coffee?" And that actually had a pretty big impact: if I met someone
and they told me "this situation is stressing me out" or "this feels bad", it was really validating for them to
hear me respond "yeah, I'm feeling this too. It's not just you." This dovetailed with my contemporaneous research
into <a href="https://ashfurrow.com/blog/building-better-software-by-building-better-teams/">building compassionate teams</a>, which I leveraged throughout this project.</p>

<p>Turns out: people feel better when they know the problems they have are shared by others. <em>Sharing</em> suffering is
actually one way to <em>minimize</em> suffering, and minimizing suffering is at the core of my beliefs on compassionate
teams.</p>

<p>Once I knew something was wrong with our team culture, I went to my manager to discuss the broad-strokes themes of
what I was hearing from my peers. I would never betray the confidence of a colleague, but being able to say "lots
of people are all feeling X" provided an important data point. While leadership already knew that <em>something</em> was
not quite right, this data point was a strong indicator that leadership had to intervene quickly. I'll skip the
details of how we ultimately addressed our cultural churn (tl;dr it involved our leaders asking IC's questions, and
then listening to what they had say). I'm quite happy to say that things are a lot better now!</p>

<p>While my "have a one-on-one with everyone" project obviously didn't "fix" the situation, it put me in a position to
<em>help</em> fix it. In addition to getting to know everyone as individuals, I got to help identify and help address our
cultural churn.</p>

<p>So what next? Well, a lot, actually! Even more engineers have since joined Artsy, and I admittedly haven't had a
one-on-one with all of them. But through this project, I realized that I'm very keen to do more of this kind of
people-work. When my manager recently brought up the possibility of becoming a tech lead, <a href="https://ashfurrow.com/blog/reflecting-on-5-years-at-artsy/">I jumped on the
opportunity</a>. I started last week.</p>

<p>My initial goal, to have a coffee with everyone, remains unfulfilled. It probably won't ever be, considering that I
now have even less free time in my new role. I'm not an IC anymore – my one-on-ones have to now be focused on <em>my</em>
team. While the goal of meeting everyone for a one-on-one will never be accomplished, the journey turned out to be
more important.</p>

<p>Important both to me – getting to know my colleagues (and myself!) better – but also important for the team. I got
to help our team's culture scale up, and through that experience, I found and expanded the perimeter of my sphere
of influence as an IC.</p>

<p>I can't thank Artsy enough for giving me the freedom, as an IC, to research team dynamics, to pursue this project,
and for taking all my feedback seriously. If you're a senior engineer wondering what's next, try turning your
attention to your team. I would bet that you'll learning something worthwhile.</p>

    <link href="http://artsy.github.io/blog/2019/04/11/on-an-rfcs-process/"/>
    <updated>2019-04-11T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
    <id>http://artsy.github.io/blog/2019/04/11/on-an-rfcs-process</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Growth is tricky. Whether in terms of raw headcount or people's evolving career stages. As a team you want to
provide ways in which members can experiment with new ideas, and provide tools to help them offer new perspectives.
One of our greatest tools for instituting change at Artsy is our RFC process.</p>

<p>An RFC is a Request For Comments, and it is a structured document (in the form of GitHub issue normally) which
offers a change to something. The format is used in large open source projects like: React
(<a href="https://github.com/reactjs/rfcs/blob/master/README.md">Overview</a>,
<a href="https://github.com/reactjs/rfcs/blob/master/0000-template.md">Template</a>), Swift
(<a href="https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/process.md#how-to-propose-a-change">Overview</a>,
<a href="https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/0000-template.md">Template</a>) and Rust
(<a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs#rust-rfcs">Overview</a>,
<a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/blob/master/0000-template.md">Template</a>). To give core &amp; non-core contributors a
chance to propose an idea to everyone before implementing a change.</p>

<p>We <a href="https://github.com/artsy/README/blob/master/culture/engineering-principles.md#own-your-dependencies">took</a> this idea and applied to the process of making any cultural change in the company. Read on to find out
why we needed it, how we refined it, some of the tooling we built around it, and what other options are available.</p>

<!-- more -->


<a name="Why.did.we.create.an.RFC.process."></a>
<h2>Why did we create an RFC process?</h2>

<p>We created the RFC process in parallel with <a href="https://github.com/danger/peril">Peril</a> being <a href="/blog/2017/09/04/Introducing-Peril/">introduced at Artsy</a>. Prior to
Peril, most changes to culture were localised in different teams. However, once Peril gave us the ability to create
cultural rules across all engineering repos in GitHub we also needed a way to let people know and provide feedback
about these changes.</p>

<p>We started with the <a href="https://github.com/artsy/peril-settings/pull/4">smallest possible implementation</a> of an RFC and a <a href="https://artsy.slack.com/archives/C02BC3HEJ/p1503690782000372">notification service</a>🔒. You
would write an issue with this template:</p>

<pre><code>Title: "RFC: Add an emoji for when a node package is version bumped"

Proposal: If the repo has a `package.json`, we should look to see if its version has
          changed and then submit a tada emoji.

Reasoning: A release is important, we should cherish them.

Exceptions: None
</code></pre>

<p>This RFC came with a Peril rule that would post a notification into slack about an RFC being created:</p>

<p><img src="/images/intro-rfcs/first-rfc.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Which meant everyone had the chance to know in-advance that a change was being discussed because it crossed team
communication boundaries. Here's <a href="https://github.com/artsy/artsy-danger/issues/5">the first RFC</a> used at Artsy.</p>

<p>This was specifically built to be the minimum possible to get an idea of what we actually wanted from an RFC
process for cultural changes.</p>

<a name="How.did.it.evolve."></a>
<h2>How did it evolve?</h2>

<p>Version 2 of our RFC process is what we've stuck with for the last 2 years. The second version expanded the scope
from just making Peril changes to being comprehensive enough to cover most cultural changes we wanted.</p>

<pre><code>Title: "RFC: Add a Markdown Spell Checker to all Markdown docs in PR"

## Proposal:

Apply a spell checker to every markdown document that appears in a PR.

## Reasoning

We want to have polished documents, both internally and externally. Having a spellcheck
happening without any effort on a developers part means that we'll get a second look at
any documentation improvements on any repo.

## Exceptions:

This won't be perfect, but it is better to get something working than to not have it at all.
I added the ability to ignore files: so CHANGELOGs which tend to be really jargon heavy will
be avoided in every repo.

Other than that, we can continue to build up a global list of words to ignore.

## Additional Context:

You can see our discussion [in slack here](/link/to/slack.com)
</code></pre>

<p>This version also came with a recommendation on how to resolve the RFC, after a week you would add a comment and
close the issue:</p>

<pre><code>## Resolution
We decided to do it.

## Level of Support
3: Majority acceptance, with conflicting feedback.

#### Additional Context:
Some people were in favor of it, but some people said they didn't want to do it for project X.

## Next Steps
We will implement it.

#### Exceptions
We will not implement it on project X. We will revisit the decision in 1 year.
</code></pre>

<p>We've evolved the closing an RFC process since then:</p>

<ul>
<li>To <a href="https://github.com/artsy/README/issues/162">be more specific on how/when to close an RFC</a>. Which introduces a stalled state. Turns out some
discussions take longer to resolve than a week</li>
<li>Peril would post <a href="https://github.com/artsy/peril-settings/pull/46">multiple notifications</a> over the course of a week to make sure people don't miss the
chance to contribute</li>
<li>We added a weekly summary of open RFCs into Slack for our <a href="https://github.com/artsy/README/blob/master/events/open-standup.md#during-standup">team standup</a></li>
</ul>


<p><img src="/images/intro-rfcs/summary.png" alt="/images/intro-rfcs/summary.png" /></p>

<a name="What.are.the.alternatives."></a>
<h2>What are the alternatives?</h2>

<p>This RFC process is not without it's trade-offs.</p>

<p>An RFC is built with an action in mind, and it explicitly defaults towards this. This process purposely bakes in
silence as positive indifference from observers. When being used as a consensus device, an RFC process really isn't
that great. It's an asynchronous, flat conversation, which makes it hard to discuss all avenues with many
simultaneous voices and can sometimes feel like whoever posts the most often kinda wins.</p>

<p>For consensus tools you really are better off with a meeting. There are all sorts of structured meetings which do a
great job of finding agreement across many opinions.</p>

<p>For example, we wanted to try and get consensus on how to build APIs at Artsy. The RFC for that would probably have
been something like "Move to use GraphQL in all new APIs", which is a nuanced technical mandate that would require
buy in from many people. While it does have an direct action, trying to feel like everyone agrees and will work
this way in the future would have probably not worked out in a single-threaded long-form issue. Instead, we opted
to use a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Town_hall_meeting">town-hall style</a> meeting, where people who had strong opinions would have time to present them - then
at the end all developers would have the chance for feedback.</p>

<a name="Where.does.it.work.best."></a>
<h2>Where does it work best?</h2>

<p>This RFC process is good for "I would like to improve this, does that make sense?" - and it's a really great case
of <a href="https://github.com/artsy/README/blob/master/culture/engineering-principles.md#minimal-viable-process">Minimum Viable Process</a> where one issue can spark a great team discussion. Here's some of my favourite
ones from Artsy:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/artsy/README/issues/171">Provide explicit recommendations when PDDE should take time off </a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/artsy/README/issues/131">Document the rationale for why Artsy's various closed source repositories aren't open</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/artsy/README/issues/86">Relaunch the Platform practice</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/artsy/README/issues/76">New Hire Buddies</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/artsy/README/issues/31">All GraphQL API servers have a root <code>_schema.graphql</code> file </a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/artsy/README/issues/117">New dependencies to Emission/Reaction go through the RFC process</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/artsy/README/issues/108">Creating a public facing status page</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/artsy/README/issues/130">Updates to On-Call Process: Jira Ops + Status Page</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/artsy/README/issues/10">Rename the Artsy Omakase to [Something]</a></li>
</ul>


<p>We sometimes have RFCs which we don't want to discuss in public, for those we use our private version of README
called potential. That said, our notification system works on any repo, so if it makes sense to have an RFC on a
repo specifically, that's no problem too.</p>

<p>You can see all of our <a href="https://github.com/search?q=org%3Aartsy+is%3Aissue+label%3ARFC+is%3Aopen">current open RFCs on the Artsy org here</a>, and I've opened comments for folks
to talk below about whether they've enacted something similar - would love to see how this can be improved.</p>

    <link href="http://artsy.github.io/blog/2019/03/12/so-you-want-to-be-an-engineer/"/>
    <updated>2019-03-12T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
    <id>http://artsy.github.io/blog/2019/03/12/so-you-want-to-be-an-engineer</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>First of all, that's very exciting! Software engineering is pretty darn cool—you get to learn lots of new things,
understand the technology you use every day better, and contribute to the mysterious maw known as "the internet".</p>

<p>Last February, I also decided that I wanted to pursue computer engineering. I'd been at Artsy for a bit less than
two years at that point, first as a marketing intern working on SEO and then as a coordinator on the CRM (read:
email) team. I'd consistently been working on small technical projects; first doing
<a href="https://github.com/artsy/positron/commit/3176282a3ea94c626e9d851b7c0dd27a1bb0fcb4">some work</a> on a tool for SEO
optimization for our Editorial team, then building
<a href="http://artsy.github.io/blog/2018/11/19/mjml/">emails with MJML</a>, and a few other bits and bobs. But I didn't think
of it as a serious pursuit.</p>

<p>Mostly, that was due to my experience programming in the past—I did about half a CS major in undergrad. At the
time, I felt that programming wasn't right for me, and I dropped the major during my third year.</p>

<p>It was Artsy's Engineering team that convinced me that programming was something that I both wanted to and could
do. Our engineers have always welcomed learners and been happy to answer questions and empower other teams to do
technical work. I eventually realized that the parts of my work where I was coding were the parts I enjoyed the
most, and that I would likely feel more fulfilled if I made programming my full-time occupation.</p>

<p>Here's what that journey looked like. Hopefully my experience proves helpful to you as you begin (or finish) yours!</p>

<!-- more -->


<a name="Step.One:.Tell.People.What.You.Want"></a>
<h1>Step One: Tell People What You Want</h1>

<p>This might've been the single biggest learning I took away from this experience: <em>if you tell people you want
something, you might just get it.</em></p>

<p>That may sound super obvious. It wasn't for me. I've usually been very passive in my career decisions, taking the
path of least resistance and considering myself lucky when I was able to keep progressing. In this case, I was
making a substantial departure from that idea by being proactive about what it was I wanted.
<a href="https://engineering.gusto.com/i-didnt-want-to-be-a-manager-anymore-and-the-world-didnt-end/">This post</a> by
<a href="https://twitter.com/NoaElad">Noa Elad</a> does a great job with this topic and is certainly worth a read.</p>

<p>The first person I told at Artsy was <a href="https://twitter.com/orta">Orta</a>. He'd often encouraged me to develop my
technical skills, and since he knows Artsy's engineering team and stack better than just about anyone, I figured
he'd be able to point me in the right direction when it came to learning resources and navigating company politics
to get to my eventual goal.</p>

<p>The second person I told was my manager on the CRM team. I fortunately had a very good relationship with my manager
and was confident that she would help me if she could. And by telling her early, I was giving her more opportunity
to advocate for me and making it easier for her to replace me in the event that I was able to switch teams.</p>

<p>The third person I told was Artsy's CTO, <a href="https://www.dblock.org/">dB</a>. This was Orta's recommendation—dB would be
able to tell me if and when a move might be possible, and he could suggest things I should do to improve my chances
of making the switch.</p>

<p>I also didn't keep it a secret from the rest of my team or the company. I didn't show up wearing a shirt that said
"ENGINEER" on it, but I told people, "I'm working on becoming an engineer. I'm really hoping to stay at Artsy, but
if there's not a role open for me, that's fine—I'll search elsewhere."</p>

<p>The net outcome of these conversations was that there wasn't a role open right then (and that I still had lot to
learn before I'd be ready when one became available), but I also left with a better idea of what I should learn and
what I could expect from the coming months.</p>

<a name="Step.Two:.Figure.Out.What.You.Want.to.Learn"></a>
<h1>Step Two: Figure Out What You Want to Learn</h1>

<p>The answer to that question really depends on who you are, where you work, and where you <em>want</em> to work.</p>

<p>I wanted to work at Artsy, and I felt that I was most interested in front-end work. So I asked a few of our
engineers to help me understand our stack and to recommend frameworks/languages I should learn.</p>

<p>If you're interested in changing companies as well as careers, it's worth seeing if your target company or
companies have open source code you can check out. See if you can find them on <a href="https://www.github.com">GitHub</a> and
look at some of their recently updated repos. If you already have some coding experience, see if you can contribute
a little bit—even fixing small bugs or typos is a good place to start, since you're both contributing to their
codebase (which will help you if you land an interview) and learning more about their stack. dB recommended that I
do this with Artsy's code.</p>

<p>As with most companies that have been around for more than a year or two, Artsy is home to projects with many
different stacks. However, most of our newer front-end stuff—things that are recently updated or currently in
development—is built on React using TypeScript. So my first question was "what do I need to know in order to write
TypeScript code in a React framework?"</p>

<p>Fortunately, a lot of other people have the same question.</p>

<a name="Step.Three:.Decide.How.You.Want.to.Learn.It"></a>
<h1>Step Three: Decide How You Want to Learn It</h1>

<p>First: <strong>there is no wrong way to go about learning to code</strong>. Whether it takes you 6 months or 6 years, whether
you learn one language or a dozen, whether you ask for a lot of help or do it all yourself, <strong>you are learning and
that is valuable</strong>. Learning to code is not a magical skill. Like just about everything, it's a matter of putting
in time. Just keep trying, even small things, and you <em>will</em> make progress.</p>

<p>Lots of people who want to become engineers go to coding bootcamps like <a href="https://flatironschool.com/">Flatiron</a> or
<a href="https://generalassemb.ly/">General Assembly</a>. That's a very reasonable thing to do! I had a decent grounding in CS
fundamentals thanks to my experience in undergrad, and as a result, I initially decided I wouldn't do a coding
bootcamp—I felt I had enough experience to benefit from the multitude of online courses and open source projects
out there.</p>

<p>However, there are definitely real and significant benefits do doing a bootcamp. Here are three that I can think
of:</p>

<ol>
<li>Clear curriculum. At times, I was overwhelmed by the possible ways to proceed and stopped making progress as a
result. Bootcamps take the guesswork out.</li>
<li>Timeline. Because I didn't have a hard date set for a transition or interview, it was up to me to determine how
fast/slow I worked on things, and I stagnated at times as a result.</li>
<li>Community. While the open source community is very much a real thing, and you can find lovely people on the
internet who want to help learners like yourself, it's not the same as having multiple people learning the same
thing at the same time in the same physical space.</li>
</ol>


<p>The downsides, of course, are that coding bootcamps are expensive and time-consuming. Most of us don't have the
luxury to leave a job, pay $10K – $15K in fees, and spend a couple months at a full-time bootcamp with no income.
There are other models, such as online-only bootcamps or after-hours classes, but those come with challenges of
their own.</p>

<p>I'd say that If you can afford a bootcamp and have the time, it's a great way to jumpstart a coding career, but you
don't have to attend one to become a good engineer.</p>

<p>If you decide to go the non-bootcamp route, you also have a lot of good options. I did courses through
<a href="https://www.udemy.com">Udemy</a>, which has a lot of courses that are literally always on sale for $10 - $20. There
are many other similar services out there as well, like <a href="https://www.udacity.com">Udacity</a>,
<a href="https://www.codecademy.com/">Codecademy</a>, and <a href="https://teamtreehouse.com/">Treehouse</a>.</p>

<p>I also highly recommend attending IRL meetups, because that's where you can make connections and learn from others
most easily. I'm a semi-regular attendee at the <a href="https://www.meetup.com/CocoaPods-NYC/">CocoaPods meetup</a> hosted by
<a href="https://twitter.com/ashfurrow">Ash</a> and Orta at Artsy HQ, and <a href="https://www.meetup.com/find/tech/">meetup.com</a> and
<a href="https://peerlab.community/">peerlab.community</a> are great places to find other events.</p>

<a name="Step.Four:.Get.Comfortable.Not.Knowing.Things"></a>
<h1>Step Four: Get Comfortable Not Knowing Things</h1>

<p>When learning engineering concepts (and practicalities), there's a lot you're not going to know.</p>

<p>This piece of advice is important both when learning and once you actually land an engineering job (it's been one
of the hardest parts of my first ~3 months on Artsy engineering).</p>

<p>Part of what makes engineering so cool is that you are always challenged to learn new things and solve new
problems. But especially at first, the mental toolbox you have is pretty limited. When you don't know a language or
framework, it's very hard to solve problems using it—your first problems are likely to be syntax errors and
misunderstandings.</p>

<p>One of the best things you can do is learn how to ask good questions and then ask them. You might be asking them on
a forum, in GitHub issues, in meetings, or in conversation with your
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rubber_duck_debugging">favorite rubber duck</a>. Regardless, just asking them will
help, and asking lots of questions is one of the best way to learn things fast—but it takes humility and
self-awareness. <a href="https://twitter.com/b0rk">Julia Evans</a> has a <a href="https://jvns.ca/wizard-zine.pdf">great zine</a> that
has good advice on asking questions, among many other things. For a few more fun and helpful resources, see
<a href="https://github.com/artsy/README/blob/master/resources/tech-learning.md">Artsy's README</a>.</p>

<a name="Step.Five:.Recognize.What.You.Bring.to.the.Table"></a>
<h1>Step Five: Recognize What You Bring to the Table</h1>

<p>Ok, so you're reconciled to the fact that you have a lot to learn—but what about all the things you already know?
Those are important too!</p>

<p>Even if your past work and/or life experience has nothing to do with computers or programming, it can still have
value as you work towards engineering (and after you become an engineer). That value can take a lot of different
forms, and since everyone's experiences are different, I can't say for sure what impact your prior knowledge will
have.</p>

<p>For me, there are a few experiences I brought to engineering that were particularly helpful. Because I was
transitioning from one team at Artsy to another (Marketing → Engineering), I brought with me a broad understanding
of Artsy's goals and needs, which helps with day-to-day prioritization. And when I'm in a sprint planning meeting
or a product review and someone has a question about email or marketing, I can often answer—or at least I know who
to talk to to get to the bottom of the issue quickly. Plus if at some point my team needs to code emails, my
<a href="http://artsy.github.io/blog/2018/11/19/mjml/">past experience</a> will come in very handy.</p>

<p>There are also life experiences that serve me well on the Engineering team. My work as a server and bartender made
me good at clear communication with stakeholders. Cooking for big groups of friends has made me better at
estimating how long I'll need for tasks. Don't underestimate the power of "soft skills"—even companies like Google
<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/answer-sheet/wp/2017/12/20/the-surprising-thing-google-learned-about-its-employees-and-what-it-means-for-todays-students">have come to recognize</a>
that it's often the non-technical skills that separate good engineers from great ones.</p>

<p>————</p>

<p>Moving to engineering has been a tricky process, but one I'm very grateful to have experienced. I'm lucky to work
at an organization where moving from email marketing to engineering is possible, and I'm even luckier to have had
the support of engineers, friends, and engineer-friends in making the move. If you end up pursuing this course as
well, I wish you the best of luck!</p>

    <id>http://artsy.github.io/blog/2019/01/23/artsy-engineering-hiring</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Interviewing is hard. Interviewers want to make sure they're hiring the person who will add the most value to their
team; candidates want to make sure they're joining a company that aligns with their goals and perspectives.</p>

<p>Recent trends in hiring are white-boarding sessions, trivia questions, and hours of take-home assignments. At
Artsy, we don't use any of these. We often get asked why not - and how we assess technical skill without them.</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>We think our interview process at Artsy is unique, but we also think our interview process is great. We'd love to
see the tech community examine its hiring practices, and hopefully to adopt some of what's made our hiring process
successful. Focusing on knowledge and facts that are already acquired is one way to approach hiring; we prefer to
look at how a person can fill a gap in our team and help us grow.</p>

<p><aside>
  <div class="question">
    <h3>What surprised you about the hiring process at Artsy while you were a candidate?</h3>
  </div>
  <div class="answer">
    <img src="/images/artsy-engineering-hiring/ash.jpg">
    <p class="intro">Ash Furrow says...</p>
    <p>What most surprised me at the time was <em>who</em> was interviewing me. I had a teleconference screening with Artsy's now-CTO before moving on to in-person interviews. Since I was living in Amsterdam at the time, Artsy flew me to its nascent London office to meet two interviewers: a data engineer and a member of (what was then) the Arts team.</p>
    <p>I was surprised, but encouraged, to be speaking with someone who wasn't an engineer. They asked me questions to find out what motivated me, to evaluate how well those motivations would help Artsy achieve its mission. It was a natural fit!</p>
  </div>
  <div class="answer">
    <img src="/images/artsy-engineering-hiring/lily.jpg">
    <p class="intro">Lily Pace says...</p>
    <p>Everything. I was pleasantly surprised by how different the interview process at Artsy was from my previous experiences, which felt more like standardized tests than conversations. The underlying presumption with "traditional" tech hiring practices is that candidates are somehow trying to trick their way into positions they aren’t qualified for. It's no wonder that impostor syndrome is so prevalent in underrepresented groups when the interview process is set up like an interrogation.</p>
    <p>I felt like the interviewers at Artsy had read my resume and cv and taken it at face value, so the interview was spent diving deeper into my skill-set and personality and determining compatibility, instead of trying to identify gaps in my knowledge.</p>

    <p class="intro">Steve Hicks says...</p>
    <p>With 20 years (!!!) of experience as a software engineer, I've seen my share of interviews - from both sides. On the hiring side, I've said for years that technical interviews are unnecessary. If I can get a 30 minute conversation with a candidate, I feel like I can learn enough about them to know if they can do the job from a technical perspective. It's much less about knowing trivia or syntax, and much more about having the personality to solve problems.</p>
    <p>I'd never experienced that on the candidate side, though. When I did, I definitely felt like Artsy had forgotten part of the interview. Where was the whiteboard? The homework? People looking over my shoulder while I coded an anagram-checker? A technical challenge has been a part of every interview I've done as a candidate - until Artsy.</p>
  </div>

<p>Artsy's process of hiring new engineers was created and is maintained <em>by</em> our current engineers. It has evolved
over time as we learn new lessons and new perspectives join our team. Our process has always been driven by a
top-down culture of respect for candidates, which aligns with
<a href="https://github.com/artsy/README/blob/master/culture/what-is-artsy.md#artsy-values">our company values</a>. Our team
currently has 36 engineers, and we refreshed our hiring practices last year to support our team's growth; we hired
a dozen engineers in 2018. We don't use recruiters (though we did to hire our recent VP of Engineering).</p>

<p>Our former Director of Web Engineering has a blog post where he
<a href="https://www.zamiang.com/post/learning-from-artsy-how-to-hire-awesome-engineers">describes Artsy's hiring process</a>.
Though some specifics have since changed, the foundations remain the same.</p>

<blockquote><p>If Artsy has a secret sauce, it is how it hires. All else falls from the assumption that they have hired the best
people who want to work together to achieve Artsy’s mission.</p></blockquote>

<p>Our hiring process starts with an informational, where candidates are met for a coffee or over a teleconference
call. We have <a href="https://github.com/artsy/README/blob/master/playbooks/informationals.md">public documentation</a> so
candidates can know what to expect. We do a lot of these and move candidates who we think would succeed at Artsy on
to in-person interviews. The interviews last 3 hours and are split across four 45-minute
<a href="https://www.livecareer.com/career/advice/interview/behavioral-interviewing">behavioral interviews</a>, conducted by
engineers and other colleagues, ranging from gallery liaisons to product managers to editorial writers. Artsy
generally, and Engineering specifically, have both significantly invested in helping interviewers be effective and
consistent; this includes documentation, question banks, and <a href="https://managingbias.fb.com">unconscious bias</a>
training.</p>

<p>Each interviewer is given key areas to focus on, based on the candidate's background. We have documentation
specifying how to evaluate each of these areas, including example questions. These areas include, but aren't
limited to:</p>

<ul>
<li>Comprehension of Artsy</li>
<li>Artsy company values alignment</li>
<li>Ability to communicate complex ideas</li>
<li>Learning and adaptation</li>
<li>Self-learning and drive</li>
<li>Independence and teamwork</li>
<li>Systems development</li>
<li>Product knowledge</li>
</ul>


<p>After the interview, feedback is written up as quickly as possible. To limit bias, interviewers can't see each
other's feedback until after they write up their own. The write-up includes a recommendation: do you think we
should move on to reference checks? Answers are either "strong yes", "yes", "no", or "strong no"; after everyone
has completed their write-ups, the interviewers debrief and reflect on how to do a better job next time. Their
feedback is used by the hiring manager to decide whether to move on to reference checks.</p>

<p>Quoting again from our former Director of Web's blog post:</p>

<blockquote><p>Artsy believes that 'references are not a defense against hiring poorly, they are a way to hire great people'.</p></blockquote>

<p>Artsy's reference checks are in-depth and deserve their own blog post; they are <em>key</em> to our hiring process. We
know that job interviewers only evaluate how good someone is at interviewing, so we put a larger emphasis than most
companies on references. The most accurate predictor of future job performance is past job performance, not how
well someone can perform in an interview.</p>

<p>If we decide to hire the candidate, we make them a job offer. Artsy offers what we think is a fair wage based on
the local market and the candidate; we do not low-ball candidates and we don't negotiate on compensation.</p>

<a name="What.s.wrong.with.typical.hiring.practices."></a>
<h2>What's wrong with typical hiring practices?</h2>

<p>There are many tactics for assessing a candidate's technical abilities, but we've found that many are unfair to the
candidate. Some strategies put unnecessary pressure on the candidate. Some select against qualified candidates who
have competing responsibilities outside work. Some unwittingly weed out underrepresented applicants, even at a time
when companies are trying to diversify their teams.</p>

<a name="In-person.coding.challenges"></a>
<h3>In-person coding challenges</h3>

<p>The intention of in-person coding challenges is to verify that the engineer can "actually write code." This
strategy puts excessive pressure on the candidate to perform in front of an audience. This is usually not a good
reflection of what the candidate would be doing if they were hired. Sometimes it <strong>is</strong> a reflection of the
stressful conditions on the team, and the act of applying pressure to the candidate is intentional, to measure
their ability to handle it. In either case, we don't feel like this is how we want to measure engineers; it just
doesn't reflect reality.</p>

<a name="Whiteboard.interviews"></a>
<h3>Whiteboard interviews</h3>

<p>One intention of whiteboard interviews is to reduce the stress on the candidate, because they don't have to worry
about code syntax while under a microscope. These types of interviews still lead to
<a href="https://code.dblock.org/2012/12/08/five-ways-to-torture-candidates-in-a-technical-interview.html">stressful conditions</a>,
though, and they don't provide a good measure of what makes a great teammate or even a great developer. Again,
sometimes the pressure is intentional, to see how the candidate reacts.</p>

<p>It can be very difficult to find a problem that is succinct enough for a whiteboard exercise but still reflective
of the work the candidate will actually be doing on the job. The ability to write an algorithm to search a binary
tree might be reflective of whether a candidate has a traditional Computer Science degree, but doesn't necessarily
speak to their ability to build complex interfaces or streamline performance. More importantly, whether or not they
can write a binary search tree from scratch on a whiteboard doesn't even necessarily speak to their ability to
<em>use</em> search trees in day-to-day work. Questions like this can eliminate excellent developers who took a
non-traditional approach to their knowledge building but are still highly capable.</p>

<a name="Sample.code"></a>
<h3>Sample code</h3>

<p>Sometimes a company will request a code sample from candidates - after all, what shows off their ability to code
better than their actual code? The downfall of this strategy is that it eliminates developers who don't have code
they can share. Many great engineers work for closed-source companies; many great engineers have family
responsibilities that prevent them from contributing to open-source at night.</p>

<p>It is also important to consider the insularity and biases that exist in the open source community that can make
contributing more difficult for developers from underrepresented groups. A study published in the PeerJ Computer
Science journal found that women’s contributions to open source projects were accepted more frequently than men’s
contributions when the gender of the contributor was unknown. However, when the gender of the contributor was
apparent, men's contributions were
<a href="https://code.likeagirl.io/gender-bias-in-open-source-d1deda7dec28">accepted more frequently than women's</a>.</p>

<a name="Take-home.challenges"></a>
<h3>Take-home challenges</h3>

<p>The most recent trend in hiring is the take-home exercise. The goal is honorable - have the candidate produce code
on their own time, so they aren't overwhelmed with the pressure of an audience. We’ve found that requiring this
early in the process is unfair, and including it later in the process is uninformative; by the time a take-home
challenge would be appropriate, we have already evaluated the candidate's technical skills to our satisfaction
(more on that later).</p>

<p>This strategy also assumes the candidate has time to work on homework. Many single parents do not for example, nor
do engineers who care for family members. There can also be misalignment on the expected time to complete a
take-home challenge. While the exercise might take a current engineer at the company 2 hours to complete, that
doesn't consider several factors: (1) a candidate might not be familiar with all technologies requested, and can
easily lose time to research and learning; (2) the candidate wants to look good, so they're likely to work longer
than you expect; and (3) the candidate might be interviewing for several companies at once, and have multiple
competing assignments to work on.</p>

<p>Many companies use take-home challenges early in the hiring process to shift the burden of evaluation from the
company on to the candidates themselves. This unfairly excludes lots of potentially amazing colleagues.</p>

    <h3>Why do you think these kinds of bad hiring practices are so common in the tech industry? And what sets hiring practices in tech apart from hiring in other industries?</h3>
  </div>

    <img src="/images/artsy-engineering-hiring/steve.jpg">
    <p class="intro">Steve Hicks says...</p>
    <p>We are very logical people in the tech industry. We want to create algorithms or heuristics for everything, including hiring. Using a yardstick like "Fizz Buzz" or trivia questions allows us to easily narrow down the candidate pool. It's a simple, intentional form of gate-keeping. The hiring algorithm is much easier to write when it's "Oh, you don't know what a closure is? Sorry, we're not interested." It's much harder to write a hiring algorithm that respects nuance: "well...it depends. Maybe you have different experiences than I do. It'll take some digging to find out if our experiences will complement each other."</p>

    <p class="intro">Lily Pace says...</p>
    <p>I think the tech industry has an elitism problem, and this is reflected in the way candidates are evaluated. There’s a general feeling in some parts of the industry that what we do is different and somehow elevated from other professions, that engineering is a skill that only a select few are capable of, not something that anyone can learn with the right training and enthusiasm. Making candidates go through a gauntlet of challenges during the interview process reinforces this idea.</p>

  <div class="answer">
    <img src="/images/artsy-engineering-hiring/ash.jpg">
    <p class="intro">Ash Furrow says...</p>
    <p>I think when looking at the current state of the computer programming industry, and its hiring practices, we need to pay special attention to its history. The original computer programmers of the twentieth century were women, but they were <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/careers/2017/aug/10/how-the-tech-industry-wrote-women-out-of-history">systematically pushed out of the industry</a>. One way they were pushed out was through discriminatory hiring practices, especially interview questions and techniques specifically designed to exclude non-white, non-male applicants. Sadly, these hiring practices persist, even if their original motivations have been obscured by time.</p>
  </div>
</aside></p>

<a name="What.we.do.instead"></a>
<h2>What we do instead</h2>

<p>In addition to the above strategies not being fair, we've found that they measure things that are secondary to what
we're looking for.</p>

<p>Artsy is more complicated than FizzBuzz. Too complicated for any one engineer to build, in fact. Individual
engineers working alone can’t build the software Artsy needs to succeed – they must work together. So the skills we
evaluate for are things like empathy, communication, and kindness. Not that technical skills aren’t important, but
the ability to communicate and learn is more important.</p>

<p>Engineers who excel at empathy, communication, and kindness can pick up the technical stuff once they're hired;
personal and interpersonal skills are harder to teach. Adding a colleague to the team who lacks these skills could
harm the culture we've built.</p>

<p>When you interview with Artsy as an engineer, you won't just meet other engineers and a manager. You'll meet with
people from other departments too. If you're hired as an Artsy engineer, you're going to work with folks from all
across the company - we want to make sure you can communicate with them because that's something we do every day.</p>

    <p>I had a negative experience in the past with a coworker who lacked empathy and boundaries and made me feel unwelcome and othered as the only woman on the team and someone from a non-traditional background. It made me afraid to ask for help and stifled my progress. This experience made me hesitant to open up to new coworkers, especially when I needed assistance. Because Artsy evaluates candidates based on empathy, communication, and kindness, I arrived with a <a href="https://medium.com/artsy-blog/what-it-feels-like-to-work-in-a-supportive-environment-for-female-engineers-3c994a001007">level of trust in my new coworkers</a> that usually takes weeks or months to develop. </p>

<a name="But.we.still.evaluate.technical.aptitude"></a>
<h2>But we still evaluate technical aptitude</h2>

<p>Technical aptitude is less important to us than interpersonal skills, but it is still important. Note that we said
"aptitude," not "skills": we don't expect our engineers to already know everything about the tech stack we're
using. Instead, we expect them to have a strong ability to learn our stack and use it effectively once they have.
(This is touched on in our docs on
<a href="https://github.com/artsy/README/blob/master/careers/juniors.md">what we look for in junior engineers</a>.)</p>

<p>So if we skip all the usual tactics for evaluating technical aptitude, how do we do it? <strong>By talking to people</strong>.</p>

<p>We learn a lot about candidates in their interviews. We'll have a conversation with them about technology. Instead
of white-boarding, we ask them to describe what they like about their favorite library, or what they wish they
could change. We ask them to describe some legacy code they’ve worked with, and ask them how they think it got that
way. We’re looking for a mix of technical skills as well as empathy and an ability to communicate nuanced ideas.</p>

<a name="References.are.important.to.us"></a>
<h2>References are important to us</h2>

<p>We also learn a lot through reference checks. Our reference checks aren't simply validation of your employment
history - they are a 30 minute-long conversation with each of your three references that go into detail about your
work history and career growth. It's quite an in-depth conversation, with questions structured to dig into
specifics about the candidate's behavior.</p>

<p>An Artsy reference call might include the following structured questions:</p>

<blockquote><p>In your capacity as [relationship to the candidate], how many people have you worked with in the candidate's
role?</p>

<p>Okay, in <em>just</em> terms of job performance, how you rank the candidate out of that [X] many people?</p>

<p>Okay, finally, what's the difference between [the candidate's rank] and number one? How would the candidate need
to grow to get to number one?</p></blockquote>

<p>The first question establishes the context for the reference. The second question primes the reference to use that
context when answering the next question. The third question is what we're <em>actually</em> interested in. These aren't
easy or comfortable questions, but they give us an insight into the candidate's career, history, and areas to grow.</p>

<p>Fully half of our decision to make an offer or not is based on our reference checks. Artsy Engineering candidates
go through the same reference check process as anyone applying for a job at Artsy, with Engineers sitting in on the
call with Artsy's hiring staff.</p>

<a name="But.seriously..we.really.care.about.the.personal.side"></a>
<h3>But seriously, we really care about the personal side</h3>

<p>We also make sure every interview ends amicably. No candidate should feel bad after interviewing with Artsy, even
if we don't give them an offer. This seems self-evident to us, given our values, but it makes a lot of business
sense to maintain our reputation as an engineering team.</p>

<a name="Our.hiring.practice.philosophy"></a>
<h2>Our hiring practice philosophy</h2>

<p>One of our core values at Artsy is that
<a href="https://github.com/artsy/README/blob/master/culture/what-is-artsy.md#people-are-paramount">People Are Paramount</a>.
We like to think that our interview process was built to reflect this.</p>

<p>We see the interview process as an opportunity to build a relationship with a candidate. We talk to them to find
out if they're a good fit for Artsy, and we help them decide if Artsy is a good fit for them. Our hiring process
focuses more on human skills than most processes do. It's not perfect, but it has served us well.</p>

    <p class="intro">Lily Pace says...</p>
    <p>I think Artsy is really unique and innovative in how it evaluates candidates and I think the more we can express this in our job postings the better.

    <img src="/images/artsy-engineering-hiring/ash.jpg">
    <p class="intro">Ash Furrow says...</p>
    <p>I think one area we've historically struggled with, and still do, is sourcing candidates from a wide range of backgrounds. Artsy Engineering's hiring pool still draws heavily from the professional networks of existing Artsy staff; while this has a lot of benefits, it also has the potential to exclude groups who aren't already represented on our team.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="answer">
    <img src="/images/artsy-engineering-hiring/steve.jpg">
    <p class="intro">Steve Hicks says...</p>
    <p>I agree with Ash. I think all companies hire based on their employees' networks, because that's the easiest way to find people. <a href="https://twitter.com/seldo/">Laurie Voss</a> talked about this recently on <a href="https://reactpodcast.simplecast.fm/33">the React Podcast</a>. He pointed out that diversity at NPM has been better than average since the company started; and that the ratios of diversity have been consistent from the beginning, as a result of hiring from their own networks. I'd love to see Artsy hire beyond our networks (and as a result expand our networks).</p>
  </div>
</aside></p>

<p>Our hiring process will never be "finished" because we're always improving on it. Some recent improvements are
inward-facing to help <em>us</em> get better, like:</p>

<ul>
<li>Starting a #dev-ersity Slack channel for talking about how to diversify our team and the industry at large.</li>
<li>Integrating hiring updates into our weekly standup.</li>
<li>Creating a Slack bot for engineers to monitor our hiring pipeline.</li>
<li>Periodically rotating hiring managers to spread institutional knowledge and get new perspectives.</li>
<li>Many, many docs written on guiding the process.</li>
</ul>


<p>Artsy engineers, guided by our company values, created the hiring process for new engineers. Combined with an
iterative process and a desire to constantly improve, we've created a hiring process that is fair, effective, and
respectful. This kind of engineering-led approach is gaining popularity; for example, Microsoft recently
<a href="https://blog.usejournal.com/rethinking-how-we-interview-in-microsofts-developer-division-8f404cfd075a">revamped its hiring process</a>
with this approach.</p>

<p>We hope this catches on.</p>

<p>So what can <em>you</em> do? A great first step is to send this post to your HR rep. Another great step is to open source
your hiring documentation; you'd be surprised how motivating this can be, and it's a great opportunity to get
feedback from other companies. Leave a comment below, let's brainstorm on other ways to improve the state of hiring
in software engineering!</p>

<p>And remember: while <em>you</em> might be motivated based on what feels "right", businesses are motivated by bottom lines.
Fortunately for us, the evidence is on our side: this is a better way to hire, for everyone.</p>
