    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>C4Q is a non-for-profit hacker school based in NYC. We've had members of Artsy team help out by being TAs, run
committees and steer the curriculum as Engineers in the industry. C4Q recently reached out to arrange a meetup
between two of their classes learning Android and Web and Artsy engineers.</p>

<p>We thought it would be cool to have a talk from dB, our CTO, on what Artsy is and to also host a Q&amp;A panel with our
engineers. For a lot of the students it was their first time meeting a team of engineers, so we anticipated a lot of
question time.</p>

<p>In prepration for the event, I reached out to the internet for ideas on what sort of questions juniors would be interested
in hearing about, and people said they were also interested in hearing what we ended up being asked, and what our answers
were. This post has the youtube video of the opening talk, and our panel's Q &amp; A session.</p>

<p>It was really awesome to talk about how far we've grown as individuals, and what is important in our engineering lives.</p>
