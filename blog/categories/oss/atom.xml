<h3>Licenses For Code</h3>

<p>Attn:<em>I am not a lawyer</em>, but I have to care about this from an app dev perspective, and a dependency manager perspective.</p>

<p>Recommendation for further reading:</p>

<ul>
<li>http://choosealicense.com</li>
<li>https://tldrlegal.com/</li>
</ul>


<p>We'll talk about 3 types of licenses:</p>

<ul>
<li>Permissive: MIT/BSD, used by jQuery, Rails, Artsy OSS</li>
<li>Mostly Permissive: Apache/Mozzila, used by SVN, Firefox</li>
<li>Copyleft: GPL, used by Git, Linux, Wordpress</li>
</ul>


<h3>Common Components</h3>

<p>All share one important thing:</p>

<ul>
<li>YOU MAY USE THIS</li>
<li>NO WARRANTY</li>
<li>DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY</li>
</ul>


<p>Which is basically the crux of how we can all actually use and write OSS without ending up bankrupt. E.g. when a major component of your infrastructure "fails" - it's not the fault of the author. Example: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shellshock_(software_bug">Shellshock</a>) - no-one tried suing the maintainers of Bash.</p>

<h3>License Free</h3>

<p>By choosing to not include a license, you only applying your copyright to the code. All code is the copyright of someone, because creation of anything is covered by copyright. Copyright is, err, complex. Roughly speaking though, there is no contract between you and someone using your code. This means <em>all</em> of the power is in favour of the library author. A library consumer would need to email the author and ask for permission on a case by case basis, even then there is nothing stopping a developer revoking the ability for you to use their library after the fact. It's also different depending on the country the library author is in. However in the end the default copyright is not a license, so add one.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.codinghorror.com/pick-a-license-any-license/">This is basically the default license for code. </a></p>

<p>This means that code on a blog could not be safe to use unless they've declared its license, whereas for something like stack overflow all of the contents there are licensed under the Creative Commons. Which I'll talk about later.</p>

<p>Just uploading some code to GitHub actually does put it under a license of sort, which includes the ability for someone to fork and view the code. It's explicit in the GitHub T&amp;C, they could not have those features without it. Other than that though, you offer no contract with the library user.</p>

<h3>OSI</h3>

<p>So when we say Open Source license, we are talking about licenses that come from the Open Source Initiative. They are a pragmatic group who say whether a license should be classed as 'open source' or not. A bit weird, but they generally just debate a lot of the legal stuff in these licenses and try to find holes so that everyone is protected. It's basically a seal of approval. There are very few licenses that are not OSI approved, the one you might know is the WTFPL - which is basically default copyright anyway.</p>

<p>On the mobile team we requested that dependencies of ours convert from WTFPL so that we don’t have the issue mention about the public domain, we as Artsy have little protection against the library authors future wishes.</p>

<h3>Permissive</h3>

<p>What you think of as open source is the modern day permissive license.</p>

<p>These are the least restrictive, and are considered "business friendly." They apply very little rules between author and library consumer.</p>

<p>People use permissive licenses because conceptually they allow the most programmer freedom to use, change and improve a library.</p>

<p>They also protect the author, in the sense that a consumer cannot claim that the author created the product the consumer made. They protect the author from liability.</p>

<h4>The one thing</h4>

<p>For example someone could take your library, and rename it, then apply a different license. Not breaking any rules, unless they ignore attribution.</p>

<p>This happened this year with <a href="https://github.com/Microsoft/WinObjC">WinObjC</a>
Microsoft's version of Objective-C, which also aimed for API compatibility with Apple's developer frameworks. They built it up with a lot of other source code, but didn't provide attribution.</p>

<p>https://github.com/Microsoft/WinObjC/issues/35
https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=10024377</p>

<blockquote><p>The ONE SINGLE requirement of the Cocotron MIT license is that the license text, including copyright holders, remains in the source. THAT'S IT, can you please manage to do that.</p></blockquote>

<h3>Patently Permissive</h3>

<p>Moving up in terms WRT strength of the contract, there is the permissive+patent libraries. These allow library authors to have patents on the software. This can make it more business friendly, depending on the business goals. The most common are Apache and the Mozilla Public License.</p>

<h3>Viral</h3>

<p>The GPL, and it's crew. Roughly speaking, they say that if you want to include any GPL'd code in your projects, you need to make your entire project GPL. There is an important distinction in the GPL in that version 2, and version 3 differ in important ways. The one that I think is most important is that GPL 3 allows sub-licensing. This means that you can say "I can give Artsy a license for this code under BSD terms", allowing for some flexibility in how you apply the license.</p>

<p>It's considered viral because if you have any GPL code anywhere, then everything becomes GPL.  Rule of thumb is to avoid this license, however I'd like to offer a reason why Artsy might ship GPL code.</p>

<p>On the OSS iOS side, we release all of our apps as MIT. I could be quite worried about people shipping copies of our applications. For example there could be fake versions of the Artsy app on the App Store, or competitors could use it to bootstrap. If I was very, very worried I would ship it as GPL 3 with an MIT sublicense to Artsy. This means that anyone who ships a copy of our app to the app store without our express permission for a sublicense that allows DRM.</p>

<p>Generally though we don’t need to do this because we have the ability to revoke an app’s access to the API, meaning it cannot talk to Artsy, and our apps are pretty useless at that point.</p>

<h3>Creative Commons</h3>

<p>So, the Creative Commons is a license on content like videos, images and corpuses of text. They are not OSI approved, and <a href="https://wiki.creativecommons.org/wiki/Frequently_Asked_Questions#Can_I_use_a_Creative_Commons_license_for_software.3F">actively recommend</a> that people use an OSI license for code. This is because software licenses have more to care about: distribution, compilation  and working with other license / patents. Things that you don't have to deal with WRT other types of content.</p>

<p>All CC-licensed code requires attribution of <a href="http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2009/06/attribution-required/">some sort</a>.</p>

<p>In CocoaPods all the design assets are released under CC, but all the code is BSD.</p>

<h2>Twitter Q &amp; A</h2>

<h3>Can I re-license after the fact?</h3>

<p>So, have you wondered why sometimes you have to sign a CLA ( contributors license agreement ) to work on a repo? Relicensing is one of these things. Let's take 3 examples.</p>

<ul>
<li><p><em>VLC</em> - Wanted to put an app on the app store, VLC was GPL. As each contributor owned their contributions if one single party who had contributed to the codebase didn't agree with putting an app on the store then they couldn't ship. It took an extra year and a half to get VLC re-licensed to get on the store.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Swift</em> - New language by Apple, they <em>specifically</em> ensure that people keep the rights to their contributions. This means Apple are not special. They cannot decide to suddenly switch license if Google decide it to be the new language for Android. There is no self destruct button.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Solaris</em> - When Sun got bought by Oracle a bunch of projects got canned, one of the ways that they were able to do this and to nuke the code was because they owned all the copyrights to every contribution made to the codebases owned by Sun. They closed the source for the entire OS. It was totally within their rights.</p></li>
</ul>


<p><a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=10669891">Sources</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-zRN7XLCRhc">History of Solaris</a></p>

<h3>Do I need to include a copyright banner on every file?</h3>

<p>No, it's possible that if it's likely that specific files will be used outside of the project ( e.g. your code is not totally atomic ) then it's valuable to note the license multiple times. However as long as a license is shipped with the code then you're good, if that license states something to the effect of “this software and associated documentation files (the "Software")”.</p>

    <link href="http://artsy.github.io/blog/2015/11/05/Using-OCR-To-Fix-A-Hilarious-Bug/"/>
    <updated>2015-11-05T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
    <id>http://artsy.github.io/blog/2015/11/05/Using-OCR-To-Fix-A-Hilarious-Bug</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>For a little while, we would get very strange bug reports. People would complain that artist thumbnails (viewed in several different contexts across the web and our iOS apps) would not be an image of the artist's work, but rather text, which had inexplicably become an actual JPG. This wasn't just text appearing in a <code>div</code> that should contain an <code>img</code> or something like that, these were actual JPG's that were pictures of text.</p>

<p>We would fix these as they came up, chalking the strangeness up to some relic of an old image processing pipeline, data being migrated, etc.</p>

<p>However, the reports kept coming in. This blog post is about how we diagnosed this actual bug, and how we used a simple Ruby script and OCR to help us detect and fix the existing images.</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>Here's an example of a bug report where the thumbnail for <a href="https://www.artsy.net/artist/marina-abramovic-1">Marina Abramović</a> became the text of her bio.</p>

<p><img src="/images/2015-11-12-hilarious-bug/search.png" alt="Bad Search" /></p>

<p>Here's one from our <a href="https://github.com/artsy/eigen">iOS app</a> showing that thumbnails for related artists are set to their bios as well.</p>

<p><img src="/images/2015-11-12-hilarious-bug/eigen.png" alt="Bad Related Artists" /></p>

<p>Weird right? We eventually tracked down what was going on, and it's actually perfectly summarized in <a href="https://github.com/blueimp/jQuery-File-Upload/pull/3356">this issue</a>. When someone copies text from Excel, it also generates an image of that cell or cells, and puts it into the clipboard. We immediately suspected something with <code>pasteZone</code>, and the bug was easy to reproduce - have an image in your clipboard and paste anywhere on the page.</p>

<p>We have an admin panel that allows some metadata about an artist to be edited. This includes their bio, as well as a place to upload a representative image as their 'cover thumbnail'.</p>

<p>As the issue describes, we had some text input fields, as well as a file upload form using <a href="https://github.com/blueimp/jQuery-File-Upload">Blueimp's jQuery File Upload</a>. When you don't specify a <code>pasteZone</code> it defaults to the entire document. This means that a paste event anywhere on the page will trigger that event.</p>

<p>Our editorial team was using Microsoft Excel and Word to organize some data about the artist, including bios. When ready, a team member would copy and paste the bio into the bio input text field. This would also immediately fire the event for the image upload, which now automagically became an actual picture of the text of the bio. Our API and image processing pipeline would happily accept that, leading to the incredibly bizarre bug reports.</p>

<p>My immediate fix was to specify and scope <code>pasteZone</code> (and similarly, <code>dropZone</code>) to the element the file upload widget was bound to. That would prevent the problem from happening again. Taking a quick look art some random samples of artists, it looked like potentially thousands of records might have been affected and I became interested in a programmatic way to detect these images. A manual approach would have been very cumbersome.</p>

<p>Since the images were that of text, I decided to use OCR to remove artist thumbnails that it determined had 'too much text'. This may have unset valid covers from artists that use lots of text in their work, such as <a href="https://www.artsy.net/artist/joseph-kosuth">Joseph Kosuth</a>. However, this was safe to do since we have some custom logic to fall back to an image of an iconic artwork by the artist in the case of a missing thumbnail.</p>

<p>To get OCR functionality in Ruby, I decided to use <a href="https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract">Tesseract</a>, a great OSS library. Once I had it installed, I used a <a href="https://github.com/meh/ruby-tesseract-ocr">ruby wrapper</a> to make using it easier.</p>

<p>The script eventually turned into something like:</p>

<pre><code class="ruby"># initialize and configure Tesseract
engine = Tesseract::Engine.new do |config|
  config.language  = :eng
  config.blacklist = '|'
end

# iterate over artists and pull their thumbnails
# given the URL to a publicly accessible image at img

text = engine.text_for(img)
text = text.gsub(/[^a-z ]/i, '').gsub(' ', '')
if text.length &gt; 30
  puts "Found problematic artist #{artist_doc['last']}"
  # ...
end
</code></pre>

<p>So all we do is find all the text in an image, and then remove any garbage characters or artifacts from the OCR analysis, and then use 30 as an arbitrary cutoff to determine if an image was problematic. If the image had more than 30 characters as detected by the OCR library, we wound up unsetting it from the artist.</p>

<p>The additional logic to set artist covers from their iconic artworks was already in place, and I ran this script in production, identifying and unsetting over 1000 problematic thumbnails. And we haven't gotten any new reports of this bug since then :)</p>

    <id>http://artsy.github.io/blog/2015/11/05/Emergence-Code-Review</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>We released the fourth app from the mobile team, <a href="https://github.com/artsy/Emergence/">Emergence</a>, on day one for the new Apple TV and are currently getting around 2k downloads a day. The codebase was created by a single developer, and we didn't want to keep that knowledge siloed. So, I ran an hour long code review session last night where I talked through the codebase, explained why some decisions were made and about the differences between tvOS and UIKit.</p>

<p>Given that I had been asked to write a blog post about tvOS in general, I felt that making the code review public for anyone to watch would be a nice alternative to the usual long-form writing on this blog.</p>

    <updated>2015-09-01T17:30:00+00:00</updated>
    <id>http://artsy.github.io/blog/2015/09/01/releasecop-tracks-stale-releases</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Artsy practices a sort of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_delivery">continuous delivery</a>. We keep release cycles short and the process of reviewing, testing, and deploying our software as reliable, fast, and automated as possible. (This blog has touched on these practices <a href="http://artsy.github.io/blog/categories/testing/">multiple</a> <a href="http://artsy.github.io/blog/categories/continuous-integration">times</a>.)</p>

<p>Usually, commits that have been reviewed and merged are immediately built and tested. Successfully built versions of the codebase are often automatically deployed to a staging environment. On an automated or frequent-but-manual basis, that version is deployed to a production environment. Thus, commits form a pipeline:</p>

<ul>
<li>From developers' working branches</li>
<li>To the master branch</li>
<li>Through a hopefully-successful build</li>
<li>To a staging environment</li>
<li>To production</li>
</ul>


<p>The number of apps and services we deploy has grown to <em>dozens</em> per team, so sometimes things fall through the cracks. We've been using <a href="https://github.com/joeyAghion/releasecop">Releasecop</a> for the last few months to get gentle email reminders when an environment could use a deploy.</p>

<!-- more -->


<pre><code>gem install releasecop
releasecop edit
</code></pre>

<p>This opens a <em>manifest</em> file where you can describe the sequence of git remotes and branches that make up your own release pipeline. For example:</p>

<pre><code>{
  "projects": {
    "charge": [
      { "name": "master", "git": "git@github.com:artsy/charge.git" },
      { "name": "staging", "git": "git@heroku.com:charge-staging.git" },
      { "name": "production", "git": "git@heroku.com:charge-production.git" }
    ],
    "gravity": [
      { "name": "master", "git": "git@github.com:artsy/gravity.git" },
      { "name": "master-succeeded", "git": "git@github.com:artsy/gravity.git", "branch": "master-succeeded" },
      { "name": "staging", "git": "git@github.com:artsy/gravity.git", "branch": "staging" },
      { "name": "production", "git": "git@github.com:artsy/gravity.git", "branch": "production" }
    ]
  }
}
</code></pre>

<p>The <code>charge</code> app is a typical deployment to Heroku. Work progresses from the <code>master</code> branch to a <code>charge-staging</code> app to a <code>charge-production</code> app. The <code>gravity</code> app is a more complicated, non-Heroku deployment. It updates git branches to reflect what has been merged (<code>master</code>), tested (<code>master-succeeded</code>), deployed to staging, and deployed to production.</p>

<p>Run the <code>releasecop check [app]</code> command to report the status of your apps' releases:</p>

<pre><code>$ releasecop check --all
charge...
  staging is up-to-date with master
  production is up-to-date with staging
gravity...
  master-succeeded is up-to-date with master
  staging is up-to-date with master-succeeded
  production is behind staging by:

<p>A nightly <a href="https://jenkins-ci.org/">Jenkins</a> job emails us the results, but a cron job could work equally well.</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/joeyAghion/releasecop">Releasecop</a> reminds us to deploy ready commits and close the loop on in-progress work. We hope you find it useful. (Pull requests are welcome!)</p>

    <link href="http://artsy.github.io/blog/2015/08/10/peer-lab/"/>
    <updated>2015-08-10T10:57:00+00:00</updated>
    <id>http://artsy.github.io/blog/2015/08/10/peer-lab</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>When I was living in Amsterdam, I participated in plenty of <a href="https://appsterdam.rs">Appsterdam</a> events. Things like the weekly Meeten en Drinken. I even helped lead a class in Swift. One of the events I liked the most was called Peer Lab, organized every Saturday morning by <a href="https://twitter.com/samuelgoodwin">Samuel Goodwin</a>.</p>

<p>The idea of Peer Lab is pretty simple, but also somewhat profound: developers gather in a physical space to work on things. If someone has a question, they ask the group. If you can help, you offer assistance. The goal is to foster a collaborative learning environment where everyone feels fulfilled.</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>Samuel held Peer Lab on Saturday mornings to dissuade recruiters from attending. The café where we met had wifi and good coffee, which is all you really need when you're trying to get something accomplished on a Saturday morning.</p>

<p></div></div><a href='http://photos.ashfurrow.com/autumn-in-amsterdam'><img src="/images/2015-08-10-peer-lab/amsterdam.jpg" title="Amsterdam" ></a><div class='meta-container'><header>&nbsp;</header></div><div class='date-container'>&nbsp;</div><div class='content-container'><div class='entry-content'></p>

<p>Before I moved to New York, I talked to Orta about organizing something similar at the Artsy offices. He was very receptive and excited to see it happen. I would be there every Saturday from 10:30-12:30 to host, and Artsy would provide the space, the wifi, and some free coffee and snacks. Pretty minimal costs. Orta offered the <a href="http://www.meetup.com/CocoaPods-NYC/events/222362372/">CocoaPods NYC meetup group</a> as a place to promote the event. We've also been mentioning it to people we meet at other tech events in New York.</p>

<p>It's been about six months, and I feel that the Peer Lab has been a fantastic success. Every week, I get to meet developers – some regulars and some newcomers. We sit around, talk shop, code, and hang out until pizza arrives for lunch.</p>

<p>From my perspective, it's been great. I get to meet other developers in a really chill setting, and it gets me out of the house early on Saturday. It sets an awesome tone for the rest of the weekend.</p>

<p></div></div><a href='https://instagram.com/p/5dlU_MyORN/'><img src="/images/2015-08-10-peer-lab/coffee.jpg" title="Nothing like a cup of coffee" ></a><div class='meta-container'><header>&nbsp;</header></div><div class='date-container'>&nbsp;</div><div class='content-container'><div class='entry-content'></p>

<p>Everyone seems to have a good time – people meet, chat, work away on their projects or open source or whatever. Attendance includes iOS experts, iOS beginners, and everyone in between. Non-iOS developers are always welcome, but the CocoaPods branding – and the network of people Orta and I know – make it somewhat iOS-centric. We're working on that.</p>

<p>We've been doing our best to create an inclusive environment, with an emphasis placed on <a href="http://cocoapods.org/legal">CocoaPods' Code of Conduct</a>. Importantly, the event creates a space where developers can meet, work, and socialize outside of the regular alcohol-soaked meetup scene. There's nothing wrong with booze at tech meetups, but it's nice to have a space where people can socialize outside that context.</p>

<p>The Peer Lab is a cost-effective way for Artsy to get respect from the NYC developer scene. This is good for <a href="http://ashfurrow.com/blog/sharing-is-selfish/">all manner of reasons</a>, and it only costs a pizza every week.</p>

<p></div></div><a href='https://instagram.com/p/31tKTiGZVC/'><img src="/images/2015-08-10-peer-lab/classroom.jpg" width="1280" title="The Classroom at Artsy" ></a><div class='meta-container'><header>&nbsp;</header></div><div class='date-container'>&nbsp;</div><div class='content-container'><div class='entry-content'></p>

<p>So I'm happy, the people who attend are happy, and Artsy is happy.</p>

<p>But there's a problem.</p>

<p>Not everyone can make it to Artsy's lower Manhattan office every Saturday morning. Some developers live too far away, or have family/work obligations Saturday morning.</p>

<p>...</p>

<p>I want to see more Peer Labs pop up across New York, and across the world. I want you, reader, to consider starting one. It's super easy to do, I promise!</p>

<p>You don't even need a company or sponsor to organize something like this. You'll be surprised how easy it is.</p>

<p>I have a few friends living near Toronto that get together weekly at a café to work together. They tweet about it and invite others. It's nothing formal, but it's valuable time for them.</p>

<p>A Peer Lab by any other name is still an awesome idea.</p>

<p>If you <em>are</em> a company, and you're looking for an easy way to meet talented developers, hosting or sponsoring a Peer Lab is definitely worth considering. There are a <em>tonne</em> of meetups in tech, but most revolve around evening drinks, maybe pizza, maybe a talk. A Peer Lab can help you stand out – even people who don't attend are thinking "oh, that's cool."</p>

<p>Nice job, company.</p>

<p></div></div><a href='https://instagram.com/p/yNNXtKJqrk/'><img src="/images/2015-08-10-peer-lab/couch.jpg" width="1280" title="Bart the Art Plant" ></a><div class='meta-container'><header>&nbsp;</header></div><div class='date-container'>&nbsp;</div><div class='content-container'><div class='entry-content'></p>

<p>How to Peer Lab in four simple steps:</p>

<li><strong>Pick a Time</strong>. When are <em>you</em> free to do this? Do you like working in the evenings? Awesome! Do it then. Are Sunday afternoons your jam? Sweet. Whenever works for you.</li>
<li><strong>Find a Space</strong>. This is easier than it sounds, trust me. As an organizer, you need a space that's convenient <em>for you</em>. I use my workplace because I live nearby. Samuel used a café by his apartment. Anywhere that has wifi. Pick a place that works for your time – for example, if you're meeting in the morning, a place with coffee is a good idea.</li>
<li><strong>Let the World Know</strong>. Tweet it, send it to some friends, whatever works. You could ask your employer to pay for a Meetup account. Send details to popular developers in your city and ask them to help spread the word 🎉</li>
<li><strong>Show Up</strong>. Most of success is just showing up. At the very least, you've got a nice time to jam every week, and hopefully you'll meet some other people to jam with.</li>

<p>Keep things as simple as possible so Peer Lab stays something fun that you look forward to, and doesn't become a chore. Like I said, six months in and I still love it.</p>

<hr />

<p>Peer Lab is a fun and rewarding activity. From my perspective, from attendees' perspectives, and from Artsy's perspective. It's simply awesome.</p>

<p>Whether you're a developer or a company, an expert or a beginner, I highly encourage you to start one of your own.</p>
