    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Last August, Orta and I <a href="http://artsy.github.io/blog/2016/01/26/swift-at-artsy/">led a course at Artsy</a> to teach our colleagues Swift. There were two parallel groups of learners: a "beginners" group who had never coded before, and an "informed" group who already knew how to code. This year, we're leading the course again with a slight twist: we're repeating the course for absolute beginners, and we're introduce a new course for anyone who completed last year's beginner course.</p>

<p>We're really excited both to help new colleagues take their first steps into programming, and to help returning colleagues continue their journey.</p>

<p>Today was lesson one of the beginner group, and I have a <a href="https://youtu.be/OLdSg0XpFqA">screen recording</a> of my walkthrough of <a href="https://github.com/artsy/Swift-at-Artsy/tree/master/Beginners/Lesson%20One">lesson one's material</a>.</p>

    <title type="html"><![CDATA[Handling Large OSS Projects Defensively]]></title>
    <link href="http://artsy.github.io/blog/2016/07/03/handling-big-projects/"/>
    <updated>2016-07-03T12:00:00+00:00</updated>
    <id>http://artsy.github.io/blog/2016/07/03/handling-big-projects</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I help maintain big OSS projects: from a third-party <a href="https://cocoapods.org">dependency manager</a> used in most iOS apps (<a href="https://github.com/CocoaPods/cocoapods.org">CocoaPods</a>), to the most popular Objective-C <a href="http://cocoapods.org/pods/Specta">testing framework</a> and the most popular Swift <a href="http://cocoapods.org/pods/Moya">networking API client</a>. I've been doing this for years.</p>

<p>Projects with this much impact are big time-sinks. This time comes from ensuring infrastructure continues to work, support tickets need replies, new code needs reviewing and releases need coordinating.</p>

<p><img src="/images/2016-07-03-big-oss/danger_logo_black@2x.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Last September, almost a year ago, I started work on a new project, <a href="https://github.com/danger/danger/">Danger</a>. Danger fixes a problem we were seeing in the Artsy mobile team around adding "<a href="https://github.com/artsy/mobile/issues/31">process</a>" to our team.</p>

<p>As a part of discussing Danger internally, I've referenced that building CocoaPods has greatly influenced Danger. This blog post is about the way I've built Danger, knowing fully well that I cannot afford the level of time to maintain it at the scale it may get to.</p>

<!-- more -->


<hr />

<p>Danger is a project that could end up with a lot more users than CocoaPods. So I want to be cautious about how I create the community around Danger. If you're interested in some of the baseline setup required to run a popular project, the post "<a href="https://ashfurrow.com/blog/building-popular-projects/">Building Popular Projects</a>" by <a href="/author/ash">Ash</a> is a great place to start, this builds on that.</p>

<p>My maintenance time on CocoaPods resolves around:</p>

<ul>
<li>Handling new issues</li>
<li>Keeping infrastructure running</li>
<li>Requests around user data</li>
<li>Keeping disparate communities together</li>
</ul>


<a name="Issues"></a>
<h2>Issues</h2>

<p>From the ground up, Danger could not end up as complex as CocoaPods, the domain they cover is different and CocoaPods sits atop of an annually moving (and <em>somewhat</em> hostile) <a href="https://developer.apple.com/news/">platform</a>.</p>

<p>However, get enough people using a product and you end up with three types of issues: Bug Reports, How Do I X? and Feature Requests.</p>

<p>I wanted to keep bug-reports down, as much as possible, and so I built a system wherein the default error reporting system would also search GitHub issues <a href="https://github.com/orta/gh_inspector">for similar problems</a>. Knowing this was a generic problem, I built it with <a href="https://github.com/fastlane/fastlane/releases/tag/1.96.0">other</a> <a href="https://github.com/CocoaPods/CocoaPods/pull/5421">large</a> ruby projects in mind too.</p>

<p><code>How do I X?</code> are issues that haven't appeared much on Danger. For CocoaPods we request people use the CocoaPods tag on StackOverflow. That saves us from 5 to 6 issues a day, and provides others a great place to get internet points by responding instead.</p>

<p>Feature Requests issues are always fascinating, it gives you a chance to really see the difference between what you imagined a project's scope is, and how others perceive it. One thing that helps here is that Danger has a <a href="https://github.com/danger/danger/blob/master/VISION.md">VISION.md</a> file. This helped vocalise a lot of internal discussion, and let contributors understand the roadmap:</p>

<blockquote><p>The core concept is that the Danger project itself creates a system that is extremely easy to build upon. The codebase for Danger should resolve specifically around systems for CI, communication with Peer Review tools and providing APIs to Source Control changes. For example: Travis CI - GitHub - git.</p></blockquote>

<p>As well as providing a heuristic for determining whether something should be added to Danger:</p>

<blockquote><p>This means that decisions on new code integrated into Danger should ask "is this valid for every CI provider, every review system and source control type?" by making this domain so big, we can keep the core of Danger small.</p></blockquote>

<a name="Infrastructure"></a>
<h3>Infrastructure</h3>

<p>CocoaPods has about 6 web properties, 3 of which are critical. The others can go down, or be behind the Xcode update schedules and people's projects will work fine. The 3 the critical projects are all simple, focused projects: <a href="https://github.com/CocoaPods/trunk.cocoapods.org">trunk</a> (provide auth, and submitting new libraries) <a href="https://github.com/CocoaPods/cocoapods.org">cocoapods.org</a>, and <a href="https://github.com/CocoaPods/search.cocoapods.org">search</a>. We control everything there.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the less critical ones like <a href="https://github.com/CocoaPods/cocoadocs.org">cocoadocs.org</a> have dependencies all over the show: AppleDoc, CLOC, Xcode, Carthage, Jazzy - every one of these can, and has, been a source of unreliability for infrastructure that I maintain.</p>

<p>With Danger, I wanted to avoid building any infrastructure that does not sit on top of solid, mature projects. The website is statically created in <a href="https://middlemanapp.com">Middleman</a>, using <a href="https://rubygems.org/gems/slim">boring</a> <a href="https://rubygems.org/gems/sass">old</a> technology, this means no server to host.</p>

<p>To support dynamic content on the website, I have a rake command to use <a href="https://rubygems.org/gems/yard/versions">a decade old</a> documentation formatter to pull content from a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RubyGems">13 year old</a> dependency manager - that lets others describer their project's. In order to let them keep it up to date, I have a tiny 35 line web-server that allows specific projects to trigger a new CI build.</p>

<a name="Plugins"></a>
<h3>Plugins</h3>

<center>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en-gb"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Summary of every big OSS project. Monolith -&gt; Plugin support.<a href="https://t.co/7x4vuW4bRd">https://t.co/7x4vuW4bRd</a></p>&mdash; Orta Therox (@orta) <a href="https://twitter.com/orta/status/748561323164864512">30 June 2016</a></blockquote> <script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
</center>


<p><br/></p>

<p>It's almost inevitable that once a project becomes big, maintainers have to become a lot more conservative about how they introduce new code. You become good at saying 'no', but a lot of people have legitimate needs. So, instead you end up converting your tool into a platform.</p>

<p>Some of the most interesting ideas in the CocoaPods ecosystem come from plugins.</p>

<p>I wanted plugins to be a first class citizen within Danger from day one. It's in the <a href="https://github.com/danger/danger/blob/master/VISION.md">VISION</a> file, and it's applied into how I've designed a lot of the user-facing site. I was <a href="https://github.com/danger/danger/issues/74">torn</a> after a few months of development <a href="https://github.com/danger/danger/pull/156#issuecomment-205907128">where things</a> should go. Now the core of Danger is <a href="https://github.com/danger/danger/pull/227">built as plugins</a>.</p>

<a name="Documentation"></a>
<h3>Documentation</h3>

<p>My second big project on CocoaPods was collating documentation and scoping different types of documentation. In CocoaPods I ended with:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Highlight pages</strong> (intro pages, app pages, team pages)</li>
<li><strong>Guides</strong> (tutorials, overviews, FAQs)</li>
<li><strong>Reference</strong> (Command-line interface, APIs for developers)</li>
</ul>


<p>These 3 buckets for documentation makes it pretty easy to separate where people should look depending on what they're looking for. This pattern I'm stealing outright for Danger. Just not quite yet, it's a blocker on 1.0 though.</p>

<p>One trick I took from CocoaPods is to have as much documentation as possible generated from the source code. With Danger, all of the work that's gone into documenting the code is turned into public API documentation for end-users. This makes it really easy to ensure it's consistent and up-to-date. The same tools used to generate documentation for Danger are used for plugins. Any improvements there helps everyone.</p>

<a name="User.Data"></a>
<h2>User Data</h2>

<p>Not storing any, phew! Though if <a href="https://github.com/danger/danger/issues/42">Danger as a Service</a> happens, then it will.</p>

<a name="People"></a>
<h2>People</h2>

<p>People are hard, Ash said in <a href="https://ashfurrow.com/blog/building-popular-projects/">Building Popular Projects</a>:</p>

<blockquote><p>The biggest existential threat to your library is this: you get burned out and stop working on it – and no one else contributes to it –</p></blockquote>

<p>Understanding motivations, encouraging ownership and accommodating multiple viewpoints are vital parts of anyone who wants to make a project bigger than themselves. There <a href="https://github.com/danger/danger/graphs/contributors">are lots of times</a> when I'm not the lead developer on Danger.</p>

<p>I owe a lot of this to the policy Ash and I created with Moya, the wordy "<a href="https://github.com/Moya/contributors">Moya Community Continuity Guidelines</a>" which define the expectations of the maintainers of a project towards contributors.</p>

<p>It's helped let a lot of other contributors make an impact. In the future, I hope those are the people that I get to hand Danger off to. Danger is bigger than me.</p>

<hr />

<p>Maintaining big projects is a learned activity, for most people it's a spectator sport, but it's not too hard to jump from writing issues to helping out. It's how I ended up contributing to CocoaPods.</p>

    <link href="http://artsy.github.io/blog/2016/03/14/public-speaking-part2-where-to-start/"/>
    <updated>2016-03-14T11:00:00+00:00</updated>
    <id>http://artsy.github.io/blog/2016/03/14/public-speaking-part2-where-to-start</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>So you’ve decided <a href="http://artsy.github.io/blog/2016/03/09/public-speaking-part1-is-it-for-me/">you’d like to give speaking a go</a>, or perhaps you were always interested. By now you’re probably wondering where to start.</p>

<p>There are various options depending on what you’re looking for. Would you prefer a smaller, intimate audience or would you like to reach far and wide? Is the topic of your choice suited for a quick talk or would you rather discuss it at length? Let’s have a look.</p>

<!-- more -->


<a name="In-house...Workplace.Knowledge.Share"></a>
<h3>In-house / Workplace Knowledge Share</h3>

<p>Lots of workplaces dedicate some time to knowledge sharing nowadays (and if yours doesn’t, see if you can start one!). They can be technical, for instance at Artsy we host a technical Lunch and Learn weekly. They could also be on any topic, like <a href="https://www.artsy.net/article/natalia-maldonado-introduction-to-office-meditation-5-steps-to-peace-of-mind-at-work">meditation</a>. Anywhere between 5 and 15 minutes in length is common, and they are a perfect opportunity to talk about things you know well. This could be centred around your day to day work, spreading the knowledge to decrease <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bus_factor">the bus factor</a>, or something from your personal life. I’ve given a talk on <a href="https://speakerdeck.com/mennenia/colour-theory">colour theory in painting</a> once.</p>

<p>If you have a workplace you feel comfortable at, this is definitely a good place to start.</p>

<p>One of the key elements in public speaking that is often forgotten is the fact that the audience wants you to succeed. They’re not there to poke holes or boo you off stage. They are curious to see what you have to say and learn from you. Give them that opportunity.</p>

<p>Even if your goal is towards speaking at bigger events, any chance at practicing and putting together a well flowing talk is good and shouldn’t be ignored.</p>

<a name="Local.meet-ups"></a>
<h3>Local meet-ups</h3>

<p>If you’re in a city that has a thriving meet-up scene, you may want to put your name forward to speak on a certain topic. A UK meet-up, <a href="http://www.meetup.com/NSLondon/">NSLondon</a>, is a great example of this. Many different members of the community have spoken, and it’s created a lovely atmosphere where it feels like you’re exchanging interesting tidbits of information continuously. Also for newcomers it’s created a welcoming atmosphere, as the people speaking are often people they know or “just like them”.</p>

<p>If you have a meet-up with a similar positive vibe, there’s no reason not to have a chat with the organisers and see what the next steps would be. It might even be well worth practicing a talk here, for when you’ve got a bigger event coming up and you would like feedback. Bare in mind, the audience wants you to succeed!</p>

<p>Sidenote — if your city does not (yet) have a great meet-up, it’s well worth starting one.</p>

<a name="Conferences"></a>
<h3>Conferences</h3>

<p>Often considered the most intimidating of all. People have purchased tickets and possibly travelled from far. The audience is usually in the hundreds, occasionally even more than a thousand. Even the most experienced speakers can get a bit nervous for this.</p>

<p>Funnily enough, my first ever talk, since starting out as a developer, was at a <a href="http://www.iosdevuk.com/">conference</a>. It happened to have a very friendly atmosphere and really wasn’t that scary. I can’t stress enough that, yes, the audience wants you to succeed. I remember talking through my introduction and seeing all the curious, attentive faces. They were there because they were interested. They cared for what I had to say.</p>

<p>I will say that this doesn’t necessarily mean you should go talk about anything your heart desires. Ultimately the attendees are there to learn, so it’s only fair that as speakers you’d tailor your presentation towards your audience. But more on that in Part 3.</p>

<p>To be considered, often conference organisers ask people to submit a CfP (Call for Papers / Call for Proposals). This is your chance to submit details on what you’d like to present on, although they may <a href="http://www.osfeels.com/talk-ideas/">give you suggestions</a>. You usually want to include a preliminary talk title, an abstract, and a bit of background on yourself. If you’ve done any talks before and they happen to have been recorded, it’s worth including the video or otherwise previous slidedecks.</p>

<p>As for how CfPs then get chosen depends on the conference. Most of the time the organisational committee selects talks from the proposal list. Some conferences have <a href="http://www.altconf.com">an independent panel</a> review anonymised proposals or have a system in place where <a href="http://cfp.uikonf.com/about">the community votes</a>. Once it’s been decided, they will get back in touch with you.</p>

<p>Usually conferences are swarmed with CfPs so please don’t be discouraged if it takes a few tries to get picked. It’s understandable to feel rejected and give up, but bare in mind that a friend of mine felt this way yet kept applying. He got his break at NSSpain 2014, and now is incredibly active in the <a href="http://www.meetup.com/swift-language/">San Francisco Swift</a> meet-up scene. All of this got the ball rolling and now he's given talks all around the world. <a href="https://twitter.com/simjp">You might even have heard of him</a>.</p>

<a name="Lightning.talks"></a>
<h3>Lightning talks</h3>

<p>If a CfP is a bit too much to prepare at the moment (we’re all busy) or you didn’t get in, another option is to give a lightning talk if the conference of your choice has slots. When done well, they are great.</p>

<p>A lightning talk is usually capped at 5 minutes, and gives you the time and space to cover one thing well. The best ones I’ve heard, have had one main message to convey and did so excellently.</p>

<p>They require a bit of planning as you <a href="http://quoteinvestigator.com/2012/04/28/shorter-letter/">want to be concise</a>, but will be done before you know it and gives the audience a great point of reference to engage with you. Not to mention that sometimes you might get asked to do a full talk based off these.</p>

<a name="Preparing.content"></a>
<h3>Preparing content</h3>

<p><a href="http://artsy.github.io/blog/2016/03/09/public-speaking-part1-is-it-for-me/">Choosing to publicly speak</a> and where is only half the battle. Deciding the content, formulating an abstract, talk title, and slides are not trivial. But fear not, Part 3 in this series will have you covered. Stay tuned!</p>
