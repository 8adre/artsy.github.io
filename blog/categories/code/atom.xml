    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://github.com/artsy/eidolon">Eidolon</a> is the third app from Artsy's mobile team, and it was the <a href="http://artsy.github.io/blog/2014/11/13/eidolon-retrospective/">first to be developed totally in the open</a>. It's often used as a reference for what an app written in Swift, or written using FRP, should look like. Given how interested the community seems to be around the app, it's about time we did a walkthrough of the code.</p>

<p>This was done as a part of the engineering team's weekly lunch and learn sessions, where we get together and share what we've been working on. Since most of you aren't Artsy engineers, and so you can't ask questions in-person, please feel free to <a href="https://github.com/artsy/eidolon/issues/new">open an issue</a> to ask for any clarifications.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>We released the fourth app from the mobile team, <a href="https://github.com/artsy/Emergence/">Emergence</a>, on day one for the new Apple TV and are currently getting around 2k downloads a day. The codebase was created by a single developer, and we didn't want to keep that knowledge siloed. So, I ran an hour long code review session last night where I talked through the codebase, explained why some decisions were made and about the differences between tvOS and UIKit.</p>

<p>Given that I had been asked to write a blog post about tvOS in general, I felt that making the code review public for anyone to watch would be a nice alternative to the usual long-form writing on this blog.</p>
