<p>Swift became public in June 2014, by August we had started using it in Artsy. By October, we had <a href="http://artsy.github.io/blog/2014/11/13/eidolon-retrospective/">Swift in production</a> channelling hundreds of thousands of dollars in auction bids.</p>

<p>It is pretty obvious that Swift is the future of native development on Apple platforms. It was a no-brainer to then build an <a href="https://github.com/artsy/emergence">Apple TV app</a> in Swift, integrated Swift-support into our key app Eigen and built non-trivial parts of that <a href="http://artsy.github.io/blog/2016/08/09/the-tech-behind-live-auction-integration/">application in Swift</a>.</p>

<p>We first started experimenting with React Native in February 2016, and by August 2016, we announced that <a href="/blog/2016/08/15/React-Native-at-Artsy/">Artsy moved to React Native</a> effectively meaning new code would be in JavaScript from here onwards.</p>

<p>We're regularly asked <em>why</em> we moved, and it was touched on briefly in our announcement but I'd like to dig in to this and try to cover a lot of our decision process. So, if you're into understanding why a small team of iOS developers with decades of native experience switched to JavaScript, read on.</p>

<p>This post will cover: <a href="/blog/2017/02/05/Retrospective-Swift-at-Artsy/#What.are.Artsy.s.apps.">What are Artsy's apps?</a>, Swifts <a href="/blog/2017/02/05/Retrospective-Swift-at-Artsy/#Swift.s.upsides">positives</a> and <a href="/blog/2017/02/05/Retrospective-Swift-at-Artsy/#Native.Downsides">negatives</a> for us, <a href="/blog/2017/02/05/Retrospective-Swift-at-Artsy/#React.Native">React Native</a>, and our <a href="/blog/2017/02/05/Retrospective-Swift-at-Artsy/#React.Native..one.year.later">1-year summary</a>.</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>We were finding that our current patterns of building apps were not scaling as the team and app scope grew. Building anything inside Eigen rarely re-used existing native code, and progressively took longer to build features. Our app and test target build times were increasing, till eventually it would take 2 iOS engineers to build a feature in a similar time-frame as a single web engineer. Our iOS engineers have a lot of experience across many platforms, are well versed in best practices and understand the value of building better tools to make it faster. We had the knowledge, but we weren't finding ourselves in a great position product development wise.</p>

<p>By <a href="https://github.com/artsy/mobile/issues/22">March 2015</a>, we gave up trying to keep pace with the web.</p>

<p>Once we came to this conclusion, our discussion came to "what can we do to fix this?" Over the course of the 2015 winter break we explored ideas on how we could write more re-usable code.</p>

<a name="What.are.Artsy.s.apps."></a>
<h1>What are Artsy's apps?</h1>

<p>We have different apps with different trade-offs.</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/artsy/eigen">Eigen</a> is an app where we take JSON data from the server, and convert it into a user interface. Each view controller can nearly always be described as a function taking data and mapping it to a UI. <a href="https://github.com/artsy/eidolon">Eidolon</a> (our Auctions Kiosk app) which contains a lot of Artsy-wide unique business logic which is handled with local state like card reader input, or unique user identification modes. <a href="https://github.com/artsy/emergence">Emergence</a> is a trivial-ish tvOS app which has a few view controllers, and is mostly handled by Xcode's storyboards.</p>

<p></div></div><a href='/images/emission/eigen.svg'><img src="/images/emission/eigen.svg"></a><div class='meta-container'><header>&nbsp;</header></div><div class='date-container'>&nbsp;</div><div class='content-container'><div class='entry-content'></p>

<p>Eigen is where we worried about how we were building apps, other apps are limited in their scope, but Eigen is basically the mobile representation of Artsy. We're never <em>not</em> going to have something like Eigen.</p>

<p>We eventually came to the conclusion that we needed to re-think our entire UIKit stack for Eigen. Strictly speaking, Objective-C was not a problem for us, our issues came from abstractions around the way we built apps.</p>

<p>Re-writing from scratch was not an option. That takes <a href="https://www.joelonsoftware.com/2000/04/06/things-you-should-never-do-part-i/">a lot of time and effort</a>, which will happily remove technical debt, but that's not our issue. We also don't need or have a big redesign. However, a lot of companies used the Objective-C -> Swift transition as a time to re-write from scratch. We asked for the experiences from developers who had opted to do this, they said it was a great marketing tool for hiring - but was a lot of pain to actually work with day to day. They tend to talk about technical debt, and clean slates - but not that Objective-C was painful and Swift solves major architectural problems. With the notable exception of functional programming purists.</p>

<p>In the end, for Eigen, we came to the conclusion that we wanted to work with a component-based architecture. This architectural choice comes from studying how other larger apps handle code-reuse.</p>

<p>We were considering:</p>

<ul>
<li>View Controllers being a mix of Components which could be extended using protocols in Swift.</li>
<li>JSON defined Components ( which would have ended up like Spotify's (<a href="https://cocoapods.org/pods/HubFramework">hub</a>) or Hyperslo's (<a href="https://cocoapods.org/pods/Spots">Spots</a>) ).</li>
<li>Building a Component structure heavily inspired by React ( like Bending Spoons's (<a href="https://cocoapods.org/pods/Katana">Katana</a>) ).</li>
</ul>

<a name="Swift.s.upsides"></a>
<h1>Swift's upsides</h1>

<p>Had we continued with native apps via native code, we'd have put more resources behind Swift, which had quite a bit running for it:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>It was consistent with our existing code.</strong> We wrote hundreds of thousands of lines of code in Objective-C and maybe around a hundred thousand of Swift. The majority of the team had 5+ years of Cocoa experience and no-one needs to essentially argue that <em>continuing</em> with that has value.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Swift code can interact with Objective-C and can work on its own.</strong> We can write Swift libraries that can build on-top of our existing infrastructure to work at a higher level of abstraction. Building a component-based infrastructure via Swift could allow easy-reuse of existing code, while providing a language difference for "new app code" vs "infra."</p></li>
<li><p><strong>People are excited about Swift.</strong> It's an interesting, growing language, and one of the few ones non-technical people ask about. "Oh you're an iOS developer, do you use Swift?" is something I've been asked a lot. The developers outside of the mobile team have signed up multiple times for Swift workshops and want to know what Swift is, and what its trade-offs are.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>It's evolving</strong> the language changes at a fast rate, with new ideas coming from, and influencing other languages. People inside the community influence and shape its growth. There are some great claims being made <a href="https://twitter.com/wilshipley/status/565001293975257091">about Swift</a> by people we respect.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Swift improves on a lot of Objective-C.</strong> Most of the patterns that we use in Objective-C are verbose, and they can become extremely terse inside Swift. Potentially making it easier to read and understand.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>We would be using the official route.</strong> Apple obviously <em>wants</em> you to be using Swift, they are putting a <em>lot</em> of resources into the language. There are smart people working on the project, and it's become more stable and useful every year. There aren't any <em>Swift-only</em> APIs yet, but obviously they'll be coming.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>It's a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/There_are_known_knowns">known-unknown</a> territory.</strong> We have a lot of knowledge around building better tooling for iOS apps. From libraries like <a href="https://github.com/moya/moya">Moya</a>, to foundational projects like <a href="https://cocoapods.org">CocoaPods</a>. Coming up with, and executing dramatic tooling improvements is possible. Perhaps we had overlooked a smarter abstraction which would have worked around the downsides, and thus making it worth expanding our search.</p>

<p>If we end up building something which gains popularity, we get the advantage of working with a lot of fresh perspectives, and being able to gain from other people working on the same project. This is what happened with <a href="https://github.com/moya/moya">Moya</a>. It's a pattern Basecamp discuss when they <a href="https://signalvnoise.com/posts/660-ask-37signals-the-genesis-and-benefits-of-rails">talk about rails</a> by beginning with a real project and abstracting outwards.</p></li>
</ul>


<a name="Native.Downsides"></a>
<h1>Native Downsides</h1>

<p>The dominant two issues come from differences in opinions in how software should be built</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Types.</strong> Types are useful. Overly strict typing systems make it too hard to <em>quickly</em> change codebases.</p>

<p>Strictly typed languages work <em>really</em> well for <a href="http://mjtsai.com/blog/2014/10/14/hypothetical-objective-c-3-0/#comment-2177091">building systems</a>, or completely atomic apps - the sort Apple have to build on a day to day basis. When I say an atomic app, I mean one where the majority of the inputs and outputs exist within the domain of the application. Think of apps with their own filetypes, that can control inputs and outputs really easily.</p>

<p>Even in Objective-C, a looser-typed language where you were not discouraged from using meta--programming, handling JSON required <em>a tonne</em> of boilerplate laden, inelegant code when working with an API. Considering how bread-and-butter working with an API is for most 3rd party developers it should come as no surprise that the most popular CocoaPods are about handling JSON parsing, and making network requests.</p>

<p>Problems which Apple, generally speaking, don't have. They use iCloud, or CloudKit, or whatever, and expect you will also. The official Apple opinion was neatly summed up on the official Swift blog on how to handle JSON parsing <a href="https://developer.apple.com/swift/blog/?id=37">exhibits the problem well</a>.</p>

<blockquote><p>Swift’s built-in language features make it easy to safely extract and work with JSON data decoded with Foundation APIs — without the need for an external library or framework.</p></blockquote>

<p>They do, but it's not great code to write nor maintain. I don't know anyone who does what they recommend in production.</p>

<p>The stricter type system in Swift made it harder to work on JSON-driven apps.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Slow.</strong> Native development when put next to web development is slow. Application development requires full compilation cycles, and full state restart of the application that you're working on. A trivial string change in Eigen takes <a href="https://twitter.com/orta/status/778242899821621249">25 seconds</a> to show up. When I tell some developers that time, they laugh and say I have it good.</p>

<p><center><blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Making a single edit in a string takes 25 seconds to see the difference in the swift parts of Eigen <a href="https://t.co/MOPGPEWqxX">pic.twitter.com/MOPGPEWqxX</a></p>&mdash; 💍rta Therox (@orta) <a href="https://twitter.com/orta/status/778242899821621249">September 20, 2016</a></blockquote></center></p>

<p>The moment that this really stood out for me was when I <a href="https://twitter.com/orta/status/271559616888967168">re</a>-discovered <a href="https://twitter.com/orta/status/705890397810257921">Injection for Xcode</a> which ruined my appetite for building apps the traditional way. It reduced an iteration cycle to about <a href="https://twitter.com/orta/status/706165678177390592">a second</a>. With Apple's resources, and the fact that Injection for Xcode has existed for years by a single developer, it's frustrating that iOS is a <a href="https://developer.android.com/studio/run/index.html#instant-run">mobile platform</a> with no support for code reloading. I filed bug reports (<a href="https://forums.developer.apple.com/thread/8796">radars</a>), they were marked as duped with no comment. I talked to Apple engineers at WWDC, the idea was dismissed as "didn't work" when it was <a href="http://stpeterandpaul.ca/tiger/documentation/DeveloperTools/Conceptual/XcodeUserGuide/Contents/Resources/en.lproj/06_06_db_fix_and_continue/chapter_44_section_1.html">tried before</a>.</p>

<p>I've heard developers say they use Playgrounds to work around some of these problems, and the Kickstarter app has probably the closest I've seen to an <a href="https://github.com/kickstarter/ios-oss/tree/master/Kickstarter-iOS.playground/Pages">actual implementation of this</a>, so check that out if you're hitting these issues.</p>

<p>The Swift compiler is slow. Yes, it will improve. One of my favourite Swift features, inferred typing, can accidentally increase compile times non-obviously. Which can make it feel arbitrary about what code takes longer to compile or not. We eventually <a href="https://github.com/artsy/eigen/pull/1465">automated having our CI warn us</a> whether the code we were adding was slow as it felt hard to predict.</p></li>

<a name="React.Native"></a>
<h1>React Native</h1>

<p>You may want to read our announcement of switching to <a href="/blog/2016/08/15/React-Native-at-Artsy/">React Native</a> in anticipation of this. However the big three reasons are:</p>

<ul>
<li>Better developer experience.</li>
<li>Same conceptual levels as the rest of the team.</li>
<li>Ownership of the whole stack.</li>
</ul>


<p>However, the key part of this post is how does this compare to native development? Also, have these arguments stood up to the test of time a year later?</p>

<p><em>Sidenote:</em> I found it hard to write this without being able to comprehensively reference what we are doing now, and so, I'll be referencing a sibling article: <a href="/blog/2017/02/05/Front-end-JavaScript-at-Artsy-2017/">JS 2017</a>.</p>

<a name="Developer.Experience"></a>
<h3>Developer Experience</h3>

<p>The JavaScript ecosystem cares about how someone using the tool will feel. This is a part of what separates the good from the great in the community. It's not enough to just provide a great API, and comprehensive documentation but it should substantially improve the way you work.</p>

<blockquote><p>References from JS 2017: <a href="/blog/2017/02/05/Front-end-JavaScript-at-Artsy-2017/#Relay">Relay</a>, <a href="/blog/2017/02/05/Front-end-JavaScript-at-Artsy-2017/#Jest">Jest</a></p></blockquote>

<p>As <em>everyone</em> inside the community has both the ability and the tools to contribute to the ecosystem you get better tools.</p>

<p>Apple make <em>great</em> tools. I do miss Xcode sometimes. It's cohesive, beautifully designed and doesn't show its age. It's a perfect Mac citizen.</p>

<p>Though it's important to note that they make tools for Apple first and then for us 3rd party devs. Outside influence obviously exists, but they're shipping whatever <em>they</em> want and you can only influence that via Radars and through going to a conference once a year and talking directly to the dev tools team. Only the Swift language is Open Source (and <a href="https://github.com/apple/swift-package-manager">SwiftPM</a>)</p>

<p>There are so few well built, large developer tools for the Apple ecosystem. Developers are wary <a href="https://twitter.com/orta/status/608013279433138176">of</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/mattt/status/473544723118837760">being copied by Apple</a> - something so prevalent that there is a common word for it, being <a href="https://www.cocoanetics.com/2011/06/on-getting-sherlocked/">Sherlocked</a>. The project I've worked on for 5 years, CocoaPods, had an announcement of being sherlocked in late-2015 - you just have to deal with it. The idea that only Apple should be shipping these kind of things kills community momentum.</p>

<center><blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Alfred, Dropbox, Snapchat, Parse, OpenGL, Objective-C… <br><br>Quite the body count this WWDC.</p>&mdash; Mattt (@mattt) <a href="https://twitter.com/mattt/status/473544723118837760">June 2, 2014</a></blockquote> <script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></center>


<p>If you're going to build something amazing, only to have all support pulled out from under you once it gets popular because Apple copied it and made it for free and with a full time team behind it - why bother?</p>

<p>This makes it tough for us, as the 3rd party community, to build useful tools on the kind of scale that is normal in other developer ecosystems.</p>

<p>This contrasts drastically with the JavaScript ecosystem, check out my explanation of Jest - and compare Jest to either Quick or Specta. Then remember that only Apple has the power to do most of what Jest does.</p>

<a name="Better.Abstractions..Better.Developer.Experience"></a>
<h3>Better Abstractions, Better Developer Experience</h3>

<p>I've mentioned that the apps we build have problems specific to API-driven applications. This means that the majority of our work tends to be that we have the full data already, and need to iterate to get the right styling and logic mapping correct, in doing so we want to also make it easy to re-use code.</p>

<p>The React component-oriented architecture makes it very easy to build these types of applications. Born out of the <a href="/blog/2016/11/14/JS-Glossary/#javascript-fatigue">JavaScript primordial soup</a>, where conceptual frameworks come and go every year or so. React has been around for a while now, and seems to have a lot of momentum.</p>

<p>All of these frameworks have the same domain problems that our iOS apps have, external API stores, complex user device state and a mature user-interface API (either the DOM, or UIKit.)</p>

<p>With React, the core concept of a virtual DOM means that you can simplify a lot of complicated state-management for your application. It becomes trivial, removing the need for more complicated state-handling ideas like functional or reactive programming.</p>

<p>With Relay, we got an genuinely ground-breaking change in how interactions get handled with our API. I don't want to  work against an API without a tool like Relay again.</p>

<blockquote><p>References from JS 2017: <a href="/blog/2017/02/05/Front-end-JavaScript-at-Artsy-2017/#React...React.Native">React</a>, <a href="/blog/2017/02/05/Front-end-JavaScript-at-Artsy-2017/#Relay">Relay</a></p></blockquote>

<p>Both of these tools provide a developer experience better than iOS native tooling. React's strict state management rules allow external tools to extend a React application easily, so the onus is not on the React team to make better tools. Other projects provide tools like: <a href="https://github.com/jhen0409/react-native-debugger">debuggers</a>, <a href="https://github.com/infinitered/reactotron">external state viewers</a>, <a href="https://github.com/gaearon/react-hot-loader">runtime code injection</a>, <a href="https://github.com/storybooks/react-storybook">component storyboarding</a> all of which can be running simultaneously as you are building your application. Imagine being given the flow of all state in your app in <a href="https://logrocket.com">every bug report</a>.</p>

<p>A single press of save would take your changes, inject it into your current running application, keep you in the exact same place, depending on the type of change it could re-layout your views, and so you can stay in your editor and make your changes. <em>From 25 seconds, to less than one</em>. For a lot of my work, I can put my tests, debuggers and the application on another screen, and just move my head to watch changes propagate on pressing save.</p>

<p>So, you're thinking <em>"Yeah, but JavaScript..."</em> - well, we use <a href="http://typescriptlang.org">TypeScript</a> and it fixes pretty much every issue with JavaScript. It's also no problem for us to write native code when we need to, we are still adding to an existing native codebase. The last project I did on our React Native codebase required bi-directional JS <-> Swift communication.</p>

<p>React Native feels like the best of both worlds: Elegant, fast to work with application code, which the whole dev team understands. Falling back to native tooling when we think it will be best for the project.</p>

<blockquote><p>Reference from JS 2017: <a href="/blog/2017/02/05/Front-end-JavaScript-at-Artsy-2017/#TypeScript">TypeScript</a></p></blockquote>

<p>There's one more thing that I want to really stress around developer experience, it's really easy to write tests for our React components. Testing in JavaScript is night-and-day better than native testing. Because we can run our tests outside of the simulator (due to React's virtual DOM) we run tests whenever you press save. These tests are only the ones related to the current <a href="/blog/2017/02/05/Front-end-JavaScript-at-Artsy-2017/#Jest">changes in git</a>. The only thing we miss is visual snapshots <a href="https://www.objc.io/issues/15-testing/snapshot-testing/">from the simulator</a>, not having to restart a simulator to run tests makes it worth it though.</p>

<a name="Same.Tools..Different.Dev"></a>
<h4>Same Tools, Different Dev</h4>

<p>We wanted to stop being highly unique inside the dev team. Artsy has around 25 developers, the majority of which work with Ruby and JavaScript on a day-to-day basis. The mobile team was the single development team that didn't make their own API changes, used different toolchains and were much slower in shipping anything.</p>

<p>This isn't a great position to be in.</p>

<p>We wanted all developers to feel like they can contribute to any area of the company. For the past 5 years, the native mobile projects had close to zero contributions from anyone outside of the mobile team. Due to differences in tooling, and the idea that there was a cultural difference between us. Since the mobile team moved to React Native we have received features and bug fixes from the web team, and fit in better overall.</p>

<p>This expansion of a mobile team developer's scope has made it much easier for us to reason about finding better ways to share code with the web team. At the end of 2015, the Collector Web team introduced GraphQL to Artsy. I wrote about how this affected the <a href="http://artsy.github.io/blog/2016/06/19/graphql-for-mobile/">mobile team</a>. This acts as an API layer owned by the front-end side of Artsy. Meaning that it could contain a lot of API-derived client-specific logic. Previously, this work was done by the web team, and then consumed by mobile - now both teams build their APIs and consume them.</p>

<blockquote><p>Reference from JS 2017: <a href="/blog/2017/02/05/Front-end-JavaScript-at-Artsy-2017/#GraphQL">GraphQL</a></p></blockquote>

<p>This is not something we have explored too deeply, however we expect to be able to port a lot of our React Native to Android. I got a rough prototype ported in 2 days work. By working at React-level, and allowing the React Native bindings to handle the interactions with the host OS, we've been writing cross-platform code.</p>

<p>We consider ourselves blocked on Android support, specifically by not having an engineer in our team with <em>deep</em> experience in Android. Moving to React Native does not obviate our native skills, you're going to be significantly better in that environment with those skills than without. As we mentioned in our <a href="/blog/2016/08/15/React-Native-at-Artsy/">announcement</a>:</p>

<blockquote><p>If you’re not already knowledgeable about iOS development, are not motivated to put in the time to learn about the
  platform specific details, and think making rich iOS applications with React Native will be a breeze, you’ll
  <a href="http://www.dwotd.nl/2008/06/443-van-een-kouwe-kermis-thuiskomen.html">come home from a very cold fair</a> indeed.</p></blockquote>

<p>We need someone with a similar depth of knowledge in the Android ecosystem as our iOS, but we may need one or two for the entire team. The rest can continue to be a mix of Web and iOS engineers. You gain a subset of cross-platform skills using React Native. Had we continued down the path of using Swift, our skills would continue to be siloed.</p>

<p>There is an argument that Swift will be running servers soon, and so you can re-use Swift code across platforms. I could see myself writing server-side back-end code in Swift (you're writing systems, not apps) but it has a <a href="https://ashfurrow.com/blog/swift-on-linux/">long way to go</a>. It also isn't an argument towards using it in our native apps, we'd have to re-write servers and implement our own GraphQL and Relay stack. This also would not impact the front-end code for the web - they would still be using JavaScript.</p>

<p>With respect to Swift on Android, potentially, logic code could be shared between platforms but realistically for our setup that's just not worth it. We're moving that kind of logic into the GraphQL instance and sharing across <em>all</em> clients, not only native platforms. If you're sharing model code, you could generate that per-project instead from the server. Since GraphQL is strongly-typed, we're doing this for both <a href="https://github.com/alloy/relational-theory/pull/18">TypeScript + GraphQL</a> and <a href="https://github.com/alloy/vscode-relay">TypeScript + Relay</a>.</p>

<p>We don't know where this will end, but we've prototyped porting one of our view controllers from React Native <a href="https://github.com/alloy/relational-theory/pull/16">to a website</a>. It's almost source-compatible. This such a completely different mindset from where we were a year ago.</p>

<a name="Owning.the.stack"></a>
<h4>Owning the stack</h4>

<p>Pick an abstraction level of our application above UIKit and we can fork it. All our tools can be also be forked. We can fix our own issues.</p>

<p>In native, there are no concepts like, <em>"We'll use Steipete's fork of UIKit for UIPopover rotation fixes"</em> or <em>"My version of Xcode will run tests when you press save."</em>. Well, hopefully the latter <a href="https://twitter.com/orta/status/790589579552296966">may be fixed</a> in time, but the "you have no choice but to wait, and maybe it won't happen" aspect is part of the problem.</p>

<p>You have your tools given to you, in a year you get some new ones and lose some old ones. In contrast, we've built <a href="https://github.com/orta/vscode-jest#vscode-jest-">many</a> <a href="https://github.com/orta/vscode-react-native-storybooks">extensions</a> <a href="https://github.com/alloy/vscode-relay">for</a> <a href="https://github.com/orta/vscode-ios-common-files">VS</a> <a href="https://github.com/orta/vscode-danger">Code</a> for our own use, and helped out on <a href="https://github.com/flowtype/flow-for-vscode/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md">major ones</a>. When VS Code didn't do what I wanted, I started using <a href="https://github.com/orta/Essence">use my own fork</a>.</p>

<blockquote><p>Reference from JS 2017: <a href="/blog/2017/02/05/Front-end-JavaScript-at-Artsy-2017/#Visual.Studio.Code">VS Code</a></p></blockquote>

<p>In the last year, we have submitted code to major JavaScript dependencies of ours: React Native, Relay, VS Code, Jest and a few libraries in-between - fixing problems where we see them, offering features if we need them. Some of these changes are <a href="https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/pull/12628">small</a>, but some <a href="https://github.com/facebook/relay/issues/1061">are</a> <a href="https://github.com/facebook/jest/pull/2192">big</a> <a href="https://github.com/facebook/react-native/pull/6114">moves</a>. Being able to help out on any problem makes it much easier to live with the <a href="/blog/2016/08/15/React-Native-at-Artsy/">593 dependencies</a> that using React Native brings.</p>

<p>It's worth highlighting that all of this is done on GitHub, in the open. We can write issues, get responses, and have direct line to the people who are working on something we depend on. This is a stark contrast to the Radar system used internally at Apple, and which external developers have write-only access to. For external contributors radar is opaque, and <a href="https://thenextweb.com/apple/2012/04/13/app-developers-frustrated-with-bug-reporting-tools-call-on-apple-to-fix-radar-or-gtfo/">often feels like a waste of time</a>. On the other hand, a GitHub issue doesn't have to wait for the repo maintainers, others can get value from it and it's publicly indexed. If we had put all our effort into Radars instead of <a href="https://github.com/artsy/eigen/issues/586">issues like</a> this, the whole community would be worse off.</p>

<p>This isn't all doom and gloom. With Swift the language, and SwiftPM the package manager, Apple are more open with the feedback cycle using tools like <a href="https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-build-dev/Week-of-Mon-20160530/000497.html">Slack</a>, Mailing Lists, JIRA and Twitter.</p>

<p>One aspect of working with JavaScript that has been particularly pleasant is the idea that your language is effectively a buffet. If you want to use the latest features of the language you can opt-in to it. We've slowly added language features, while retaining backwards compatibility. First using <a href="https://babeljs.io">Babel</a>, then <a href="https://flowtype.org">Flow</a> and finally with <a href="http://www.typescriptlang.org">TypeScript</a>.</p>

<p>In contrast, and this may be the last major time it happens, but people refer to the time it took to migrate <a href="https://engblog.nextdoor.com/migrating-to-swift-3-7add0ce0655#.rvyrohyhq">in</a> <a href="https://tech.zalando.com/blog/app-migration-to-swift-3/">the</a> <a href="https://github.com/kickstarter/ios-oss/pull/26">scale</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/guidomb/status/817363981216129025">of</a> <em>weeks</em> during the Swift 2 -> 3 migration. Having the language evolve is great, sometimes in ways that you <a href="https://swift.org/documentation/api-design-guidelines/">agree with</a> and sometimes in ways <a href="http://mjtsai.com/blog/2016/07/17/swift-classes-to-be-non-publicly-subclassable-by-default/">you don't</a>. Being able to use your own version of your tools frees you to make it work for you and your business. We have been talking about <a href="/blog/2017/02/05/Front-end-JavaScript-at-Artsy-2017/#TypeScript-Extension">extending TypeScript</a> specifically for our applications.</p>

<a name="React.Native..one.year.later"></a>
<h1>React Native, one year later</h1>

<p>In our announcement we talked about the lack of nuanced post-mortems on React Native. We're now a year in, we can at least try to help out in that space. We're sticking with React Native for the foreseeable future. It would take some <em>drastic</em> changes in the Apple ecosystem for us to re-consider this decision. So here's the summary after 1 year.</p>

<ul>
<li>We can share concepts with web</li>
<li>Tools are built for apps like ours</li>
<li>To do it right requires engineers willing to dive deep in JS</li>
<li>You need native experience to have a polished app</li>
<li>Dependency stack is still obscenely big</li>
<li>Opens native engineers to more projects, makes yours more welcoming to others</li>
<li>Problems do, and will occur, but everything is fixable by forking</li>
<li>Extensive communication with native code gets tricky to test and maintain</li>
<li>We ended up re-using quite a lot of existing native code</li>
<li>It makes working in native code feel more like a chore, as you lose the JS developer experience</li>
<li>Spending so much time in another environment will erode native knowledge</li>
<li>Makes a lot of sense in an <a href="/blog/2016/08/24/On-Emission/">additive approach</a> to existing apps</li>
<li>We're not making plans to re-write other Apps into React Native, they are fine as-is</li>
<li>New apps going forward we will default to React Native apps, unless there is a good reason to not</li>
</ul>


<p>So, should you use React Native? Maybe. If you have an API driven app, <em>probably.</em></p>

<p>It's definitely worth a week of prototyping for any engineering team, then if that goes well you should look into GraphQL and Relay. They really make React Native shine.</p>

    <id>http://artsy.github.io/blog/2016/10/14/Accessing-the-Source-Code-from-your-Simulator</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>In the last few months twice I've wanted to access the source code of our application. The first time I did it I came up with a pretty neat hack, but it wouldn't really work in many places. The second time however, I <a href="https://twitter.com/orta/status/786470282093625344">asked the internet</a>, and the <a href="https://twitter.com/saniul/status/786470857635827712">internet</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/0xced/status/786619335116750848">replied</a>.</p>

<p>TLDR: You can use your <a href="https://github.com/artsy/emission/pull/350/commits/2a39c743bcaaf2e3b848ad60621198f40365fdd2">project's scheme</a> to expose derived Xcode environment variables to your source code.</p>

<p>The rest of the blog post is a little bit about <em>why</em> I wanted to do that and what I did with it.</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>Both times I've wanted to access the source code of our apps is because I've wanted to make better admin tools. It should come as no surprise to people who know me that I care about tooling, but I also care a lot about making it possible for our admins to do their own thing. As such, our <a href="https://github.com/artsy/eigen/blob/master/Artsy/View_Controllers/Admin/ARAdminSettingsViewController.m">admin settings panel</a> in Eigen is extensive.</p>

<a name="Root.React.Components"></a>
<h3>Root React Components</h3>

<p>The first time came when I started to think about what admin options I'd like to see for people using our React Native side. These are the options I came up with:</p>

<p> <img src="/images/source-code-sim/react-admin-eigen.png" alt="/images/source-code-sim/react-admin-eigen.png" /></p>

<p>There are two interesting things about it:</p>

<ul>
<li>We support running any master commit of our React Native code inside Eigen, for Admins, <a href="https://apphub.io">via AppHub</a></li>
<li>We allow loading arbitrary React components as an admin.</li>
</ul>


<p> It's this last bit that's interesting, right now I'm working on a new root Gene component (read: new view controller) in Emission, our React Native implementation. As this work has not moved upstream into Eigen, I can access it through a commit on AppHub, and then open it using our custom module loader:</p>

<p><img src="/images/source-code-sim/react-module-eigen.png" alt="/images/source-code-sim/react-module-eigen.png" /></p>

<p>In order to show the available root components (Artist/Home/Gene), we use GitHub's raw URLs to download the source code of our Open Source apps. Hah, a nice hack right? I <a href="https://github.com/artsy/eigen/blob/master/Artsy/View_Controllers/Admin/ARAdminNetworkModel.m">created</a> a <code>ARAdminNetworkModel</code> with an API like this:</p>

<pre><code class="objc">@interface ARAdminNetworkModel : NSObject

- (void)getEmissionJSON:(NSString *)path completion:(void (^)(NSDictionary *json, NSError *error))completion;

- (void)getEmissionFile:(NSString *)path completion:(void (^)(NSString *fileContents, NSError *error))completion;

@end
</code></pre>

<p>Which simply uses <code>NSURLSession</code> under the hood:</p>

<pre><code class="objc">- (void)getEmissionData:(NSString *)path completion:(void (^)(NSData *data, NSError *error))completion;
{
    NSURLSession *session = [NSURLSession sharedSession];
    NSString *urlFormat = @"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/artsy/emission/master/%@";
    NSString *url = [NSString stringWithFormat: urlFormat, path];
    NSURLRequest *request = [NSURLRequest requestWithURL:[NSURL URLWithString:url]];
    NSURLSessionDataTask *task = [session dataTaskWithRequest:request completionHandler:^(NSData *data, NSURLResponse *response, NSError *error) {
            completion(data, error);
    }];
    [task resume];
}
</code></pre>

<p>Nothing special, but it required a cognitive jump to get there.</p>

<a name="Submodule.Introspection"></a>
<h3>Submodule Introspection</h3>

<p>The second time I wanted this is inside <a href="https://github.com/artsy/emission/tree/master/Example">the example app</a> for Emission. This is a typical example application for a library made by <code>pod lib create</code>. This example app is basically just the admin settings panel from Eigen, shown above.</p>

<p>When I <a href="https://github.com/artsy/emission/pull/347">switched the</a> example app to use a similar theme and menu DSL as Eigen, I also took the chance to expand on the buttons we had available. Previously there was the ability to load the view controller for one specific artist, but I knew we had a <a href="https://github.com/artsy/metaphysics/blob/master/schema/artist/maps/artist_title_slugs.js">giant list of artist slugs</a> inside one of our optional sub-modules. What I wanted to do, was offer a random Artist from that if the submodule was <code>init</code>'d.</p>

<p>This required introspecting the source, which I could have also done via the GitHub API, but it was also feasible to do by accessing the filesystem outside of the simulator. This is totally possible ( and is <a href="https://www.objc.io/issues/15-testing/snapshot-testing/">how FBSnapshots works</a> ) but I needed to access the project root, then I could build relative links. Thus, <a href="https://twitter.com/orta/status/786470282093625344">I asked the internet</a>. I knew these variables existed, but that they were a part of the build process - and not exposed to the app runtime.</p>

<p>There are two ways to do it, both make sense for different contexts:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/artsy/emission/blob/74d0bc6cc45da906436f8bbc33710ea030657ee8/Example/Emission/Info.plist#L5-L6">Baking the value into your Info.plist</a> - which makes it available for all consumers at runtime, e.g. you could deploy this value, but it's not too useful for my problem.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/artsy/emission/pull/350/commits/2a39c743bcaaf2e3b848ad60621198f40365fdd2">Exposing it as an environment variable via your scheme</a> - perfect for this case, the variable won't be exported when you deploy.</li>
</ul>


<p>Now our scheme looks like this:</p>

<p></div></div><a href='/images/source-code-sim/scheme-settings-emission.png'><img src="/images/source-code-sim/scheme-settings-emission.png"></a><div class='meta-container'><header>&nbsp;</header></div><div class='date-container'>&nbsp;</div><div class='content-container'><div class='entry-content'></p>

<p>I can then use the value of <code>SRCROOT</code> as the start of an absolute path to get to any of the source code in our project. Making the <a href="https://github.com/artsy/emission/blob/dda57636e424ab7d4517de57f3e8bd917fcb3c6f/Example/Emission/ARRootViewController.m#L85-L108">final code</a>:</p>

<pre><code class="obj-c">- (ARCellData *)jumpToRandomArtist
{
  NSString *sourceRoot = [NSProcessInfo processInfo].environment[@"SRCROOT"];
  NSString *artistListFromExample = @"../externals/metaphysics/schema/artist/maps/artist_title_slugs.js";
  NSString *slugsPath = [sourceRoot stringByAppendingPathComponent:artistListFromExample];

  NSFileManager *manager = [NSFileManager defaultManager];

  // Don't have the submodule? bail, it's no biggie
  if (![manager fileExistsAtPath:slugsPath]) { return nil; }

  // Otherwise lets support jumping to a random Artist
  return [self tappableCellDataWithTitle:@"Artist (random from metaphysics)" selection: ^{
    NSString *data = [NSString stringWithContentsOfFile:slugsPath encoding:NSUTF8StringEncoding error:nil];

    ... and so on
</code></pre>

<a name="Tooling"></a>
<h3>Tooling</h3>

<p>Paying attention to your admin tools, and improving your development experience for the whole team is a great way to win friends and influence people. Introspecting your source code may help that.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<center>

</center>


<p>I arrived fashionably late to the <a href="/blog/2016/08/15/React-Native-at-Artsy/">React Native party</a> in Artsy. I had been a part of our <a href="/blog/2016/08/09/the-tech-behind-live-auction-integration/">Auctions Team</a>, where we worked in Swift with <a href="https://cocoapods.org/pods/Interstellar">some light-FRP</a>. We were not affected by the 4 months of simultaneous work on moving to React Native, at all.</p>

<p>It was a quiet revolution. I did not have to install <code>npm</code>, I made zero changes to the code for auctions and the whole app's infrastructure barely changed. Yet we moved to making all new code inside our 3 year old iOS app use React Native. What gives?</p>

<p>Well, first up we weren't planning a re-write, we don't have that kind of luxury and the scope of our app is too big compared to the team working on it. Second, we reused existing dependency infrastructure to support JavaScript based apps. Read on to find out what that looks like.</p>

<!-- more -->


<a name="Why.we.were.in.a.good.position.to.do.this"></a>
<h3>Why we were in a good position to do this</h3>

<p>Let's talk a little about the Artsy flagship app, <a href="https://github.com/artsy/eigen/">Eigen</a>. It's an app that aimed to comprehensively cover the art world. From <a href="https://www.artsy.net/shows">Shows</a> to <a href="https://www.artsy.net/galleries">Galleries</a>, <a href="https://www.artsy.net/art-fairs">Fairs</a> to <a href="https://www.artsy.net/auctions">Auctions</a>, <a href="https://www.artsy.net/institutions">Museums</a> to <a href="https://www.artsy.net/articles">Magazines</a>.</p>

<p>It all looks a bit like this:</p>

<p></div></div><a href='/images/emission/eigen-overview.jpg'><img src="/images/emission/eigen-overview.jpg"></a><div class='meta-container'><header>&nbsp;</header></div><div class='date-container'>&nbsp;</div><div class='content-container'><div class='entry-content'></p>

<p>Our app neatly splits into two areas of view controllers, ones that act as a browser chrome, and individual view controllers that normally map 1:1 to <a href="https://github.com/artsy/eigen/blob/master/Artsy/App/ARSwitchBoard.m#L122">routes</a> on the Artsy website.</p>

<p>For example, the route <code>artsy.net/artwork/glenn-brown-suffer-well</code> maps to the native <code>ARArtworkViewController</code>.</p>

<p></div></div><a href='/images/emission/eigen.svg'><img src="/images/emission/eigen.svg"></a><div class='meta-container'><header>&nbsp;</header></div><div class='date-container'>&nbsp;</div><div class='content-container'><div class='entry-content'></p>

<p>Just as a browser knows very little about the individual content of the pages that it's rendering, the eigen chrome exists <em>relatively</em> independent of the view controllers that are showing.</p>

<p>Each view controller also knows very little about each-other, so actions that trigger a new view controller are generally done by creating a string route and passing it through the routing system. I've wrote about this pattern in <a href="https://artsy.github.io/blog/2015/08/15/Cocoa-Architecture-Router-Pattern/">Cocoa Architecture: Router Pattern</a>.</p>

<p>Interestingly, if the router cannot route a view controller, it will pass through to a web view. This is why we consider the app a <a href="http://artsy.github.io/blog/2015/08/24/Cocoa-Architecture-Hybrid-Apps/">hybrid app</a>. This pattern means adding new view controllers is extremely easy.</p>

<a name="Introducing.Emission"></a>
<h3>Introducing Emission</h3>

<p>Emission is what we use to contain all of our React Native components. Our flagship app Eigen, can depend on and use without needing to bother with the implementation details of React Native. At it's core, Emission is:</p>

<ul>
<li>A node module.</li>
<li>A CocoaPod.</li>
<li>An iOS App.</li>
</ul>


<a name="The.Node.Module"></a>
<h4>The Node Module</h4>

<p>Emission itself, is a node module. In our case, it is a JavaScript library that exposes 3 JavaScript objects.</p>

<pre><code class="javascript">/* @flow */
'use strict';

import Containers from './lib/containers';
import Components from './lib/components';
import Routes from './lib/relay/routes';

import './lib/relay/config';
import './lib/app_registry';

export default {
  Containers,
  Components,
  Routes,
};
</code></pre>

<p>Another node project can have Emission as a dependency - then can access our <code>Container</code>s, <code>Component</code>s and <code>Route</code>s. A container is a <a href="https://facebook.github.io/relay/docs/api-reference-relay-container.html">Relay container</a>, a component is a <a href="https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/component-api.html">React Component</a> and a Route is a <a href="https://facebook.github.io/relay/docs/guides-routes.html#content">Relay Route</a>.</p>

<p>The thing that's interesting from the integration side, is that each <code>Container</code> is effectively a View Controller that Emission provides to a host application. React Native ignores  the concept of view controllers from the Cocoa world, so we have an <a href="https://github.com/artsy/emission/blob/eb9d0f6ca0edd3eb9f07dd9ff3b8499f095bc45b/Pod/Classes/ViewControllers/ARComponentViewController.m">ARComponentViewController</a> which is subclassed for each exposed <code>Component</code> class.</p>

<a name="The.iOS.App"></a>
<h4>The iOS App</h4>

<p>The iOS app acts as a host target for the CocoaPod, and provides an instance of an <a href="https://github.com/artsy/emission/blob/master/Pod/Classes/Core/AREmission.m">AREmission</a> object to the view controllers using React Native. The app is nothing special, it is the default app that is created using <code>pod lib create</code>. We then <a href="https://github.com/artsy/emission/blob/eb9d0f6ca0edd3eb9f07dd9ff3b8499f095bc45b/Example/Podfile">use CocoaPods</a> to bring in React from inside the <code>node_modules/</code> folder the Emission node module creates.</p>

<p>The <code>AREmission</code> instance is the intermediary between the host-app (<a href="https://github.com/artsy/emission/blob/eb9d0f6ca0edd3eb9f07dd9ff3b8499f095bc45b/Example/Emission/AppDelegate.m#L56">The Emission Example app</a>, or <a href="https://github.com/artsy/eigen/blob/41b00f6fe497de9e902315104089370dea417017/Artsy/App/ARAppDelegate%2BEmission.m">Eigen</a>.) It has an API for handling routing, and passing authentication credentials into the React Native world.</p>

<p>We use the example app to do development inside React Native. As of right now, it is simply a tableview that provides a list of view controllers <a href="https://github.com/artsy/emission/blob/eb9d0f6ca0edd3eb9f07dd9ff3b8499f095bc45b/Example/Emission/AppDelegate.m#L159-L169">that represent an exposed Container</a>. Once you are in the right view controller, you can rely on <a href="http://facebook.github.io/react-native/releases/0.31/docs/debugging.html#automatic-reloading">Hot Reloading</a> to simplify your work.</p>

<a name="The.Pod"></a>
<h4>The Pod</h4>

<p>An important part of working with React Native, is that you can choose to use native code when appropriate. The <a href="https://github.com/artsy/emission/blob/eb9d0f6ca0edd3eb9f07dd9ff3b8499f095bc45b/Emission.podspec">Pod for</a> Emission, created entirely in Objective-C, provides:</p>

<ul>
<li>Communication between React Native and the host app objects via <a href="https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/native-modules-ios.html">native modules</a>.</li>
<li><code>UIViewController</code> subclasses for Host apps to consume.</li>
<li>Bridges for existing native views (like our <a href="https://github.com/artsy/extraction/blob/d6a32186f7098eb2ec5d05e2fb5302a8378eff70/Extraction/Classes/ARSwitchView.m">SwitchView</a>) into React Native.</li>
</ul>


<p>The choice of Objective-C is for simplicity, and language stability. Swift is technically an option, but it's not  worth the complications for <a href="https://github.com/artsy/emission/tree/eb9d0f6ca0edd3eb9f07dd9ff3b8499f095bc45b/Pod/Classes">a few simple objects</a>.</p>

<p>In order to share native views with our host app, Eigen, we created a library to just hold the shared UI components, <a href="https://github.com/artsy/extraction">Extraction</a>. These are <a href="https://github.com/artsy/extraction/tree/d6a32186f7098eb2ec5d05e2fb5302a8378eff70/Extraction/Classes">factored out of Eigen</a>, and into a pod. Emission and Eigen have this as a dependency.</p>

<a name="Pod.Deployment"></a>
<h4>Pod Deployment</h4>

<p>What makes this work well, from the perspective of Eigen is that the React Native comes in atomically. The Podspec <a href="https://github.com/artsy/emission/blob/master/Emission.podspec#L17-L18">references</a> the few native classes, and a single JavaScript file.</p>

<p>This JavaScript file is the bundled version of all our React Native code. It's <a href="https://github.com/artsy/emission/blob/eb9d0f6ca0edd3eb9f07dd9ff3b8499f095bc45b/package.json#L7">updated  by running</a> <code>npm run bundle</code>. This generates both the minified JS, and a source map so that we can transcribe the error reports into the code we write.</p>

<p>Using the CocoaPod, Emission can provide native view controllers that use React Native under the hood. The host app does not need to know the underlying details like <code>npm</code>.</p>

<a name="On.Emission"></a>
<h3>On Emission</h3>

<p>Whether this is a pattern other apps can follow is hard to say, we were in a great position to do this. Our app has view controllers that have very little communication with each other and the host app does not need to bridge large amounts of information.</p>

<p>As <a href="https://github.com/artsy/eigen">the Artsy iOS app</a> grew larger, we started hitting pain
points:</p>

<ul>
<li>We want to support other future platforms such as Android without creating more teams.</li>
<li>We want different business teams to work on the app without disrupting each other.</li>
<li>We want our architecture to evolve in order to increase programmer efficiency.</li>
</ul>


<p>It took us <a href="https://github.com/artsy/mobile/issues/22">about a year</a> to start resolving these issues.
Ideally, we wanted to find a solution to our architectural issues that would also improve the user
experience. Notably we wanted more efficient networking, due to mobile device constraints.</p>

<p>It would have been an easy leap to start using Swift and, as a matter of fact, we do use Swift in parts of
our flagship application and entirely in <a href="http://artsy.github.io/blog/2014/11/13/eidolon-retrospective/">2 other apps</a>.</p>

<p>However, while Swift is a great language, it’s also just that: <em>another</em> language. It does not do much in terms of new
paradigms that solved our architectural needs, it does not help in terms of cross-platform - as most of our code is
building views and thus very framework specific, and it did not really offer anything in terms of more efficient network
data fetching.</p>

<p>We've seen that the web teams integrate React in their projects with really great results. We've been
<a href="https://github.com/artsy/mobile/issues/22">paying attention</a> to React Native since it came out; the solutions provided
by the React ecosystem ticked all of our boxes.</p>

<p>Six months ago we took the plunge, and last month we formalized that this is the direction we want to go.</p>

<a name="Cons"></a>
<h1>Cons</h1>

<p>So you decided to read the full post and the first thing you got confronted with is a list of cons… <em>boo</em>. Let’s just get
these out of the way first, it will only get better afterwards.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Dependencies, dependencies, dependencies, both in libraries and tooling. Once you open this can, you’ll have worms
<em>everywhere</em> in no time; 593 packages to be exactly, at the time of writing, for a new React Native project. Good luck
maintaining that.</p>

<p>Having created <a href="https://cocoapods.org">a dependency manager</a>, I’m not afraid of some dependencies and don’t subscribe
to NIH, but the JavaScript community has gone <em>way</em> overboard for my taste. If, like me, you subscribe to the idea
that dependencies are <em>part</em> of your application and you want to be able to know what packages are being pulled in so
you can maintain them, then you probably won’t like this aspect very much either.</p>

<p>I’m not quite sure yet how I feel about this in the long run and what we can do about it, short of trying to get the
maintainers of the packages we directly depend on to accept changes that simplify their dependency graphs.</p></li>
<li><p>As is often the case, error reporting does not always receive the attention it should get. With the amount of tools
and libs that make up the full stack you need to work with, this lack in attention to failure resolution can quickly
cascade into deep rabbit holes.</p></li>
<li><p>React Native is still very young and fast moving. If you don’t like living on the edge (i.e. lots of updating and
dealing with breaking changes) nor have an interest in shaping an unfinished framework, this currently is not for you.</p></li>
<li><p>All Facebook open-source code is made to solve the problems that Facebook has first, thus with young projects you may
well need to put in a bunch of time to make it work for your problem set. React Native provides a lot of basic view
building blocks, but you do lose a lot that you would get with UIKit for free, e.g. <code>UICollectionView</code>.</p>

<p>However, it is important to note that this is only a heads-up for those that might think they can solve any problem
out-of-the-box; in terms of open-source code I prefer code used in production over other code <em>any</em> day.</p></li>
<li><p>There are currently many more people trying to get help, with often arguably simple questions in the context of iOS
development, compared to those willing to spend time on answering questions. Most forums I’ve seen suffer from the
tragedy of the commons problem, which can be a real problem if you have incidental framework specific questions, but
jumping to React Native probably is a complete disaster if you know very little about iOS development yet.</p>

<p>If you’re not already knowledgeable about iOS development, are not motivated to put in the time to learn about the
platform specific details, and think making rich iOS applications with React Native will be a breeze, you’ll
<a href="http://www.dwotd.nl/2008/06/443-van-een-kouwe-kermis-thuiskomen.html">come home from a very cold fair</a> indeed.</p>

<p>While you can definitely make applications that way, in my experience those often end up not feeling like proper
citizens of the platform they inhibit.</p></li>
<li><p>Due to React Natives immaturity, you will not be able to find nuanced post-mortems on the subject. The project
is only at the beginning of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hype_cycle">hype cycle</a>, meaning there is a lot
to gain in writing about how great it is, but less incentive to discuss where it doesn't work out well.</p></li>
</ul>


<a name="Pros..why.we.wanted.to.use.React.Native"></a>
<h1>Pros, why we wanted to use React Native</h1>

<ul>
<li><p>From <a href="https://facebook.github.io/react/">the React website</a>:</p>

<blockquote><p>React will efficiently update and render just the right components when your data changes.
Build encapsulated components that manage their own state, then compose them to make complex UIs.</p></blockquote>

<p>The functional model that React introduces that allows you to reason about the state of your views in much simpler
ways has for us been a welcome change that should make it much easier to write decoupled code going forward.</p>

<p>I’m by no means a functional programming purist, nor do I really care for being one. I found the React/React Native
communities to be very welcome to functional enthusiasts and pragmatists alike, a healthy mix that I find leads to
more productive outcomes.</p></li>
<li><p>Relay. From <a href="https://facebook.github.io/relay/">its website</a>:</p>

<blockquote><p>Queries live next to the views that rely on them, so you can easily reason about your app.
Relay aggregates queries into efficient network requests to fetch only what you need.</p></blockquote>

<p>The clarity this brings to the view codebase - coupled with its smart caching, networking is just ground-breaking.
No more multiple levels of model code in your application that you need to trace, just a single file with
<a href="https://github.com/artsy/emission/blob/a2e4dbdb/lib/components/artist/header.js#L87">the view component</a> <em>and</em>
<a href="https://github.com/artsy/emission/blob/a2e4dbdb/lib/components/artist/header.js#L143-L144">the data it needs</a>. Neat.</p>

<p>We do still have ‘view models’, however, those now pretty much all live in
<a href="http://artsy.github.io/blog/2016/06/19/graphql-for-mobile/">our GraphQL service</a>. The added benefit here is that we
share that model logic with Artsy’s other (web) clients.</p></li>
<li><p>“Learn once, write anywhere.” is the neo-cross-platform slogan deployed by React, which is a play on the tried
“Write once, run anywhere.” slogan of yesteryear. The difference being that you can use the same paradigms to create
products on various platforms, rather than pure code-reuse.</p>

<p>While we haven’t put this to the test yet at Artsy, we do plan to team up people across platforms to implement single
features on each respective platform, rather than having multiple people implement the same feature <em>on their own</em>.
The hope is that this will lead to better understanding of features and thus the implementations thereof, while still
taking each platform’s unique nature into account. The added benefit would be that people learn to understand and
appreciate those unique platform traits, thus making them more well-rounded engineers.</p>

<p>In the long run, we hope to extend this way of working as we start work on a React Native Android client.</p></li>
<li><p>While Auto Layout is a great step up from manual frame calculation, most of our views don’t need the granularity that
Auto Layout offers. React Native ditches Auto Layout and instead uses
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CSS_Flex_Box_Layout">flexbox</a> for its layout. While my head has never been able to
fully wrap around classic CSS, I find that flexbox is an abstraction that nicely fits most of our needs.</p>

<p>I can definitely imagine situations in which more granularity would be required, however, in those cases we can always
decide to ‘drop down’ to native view code, so I don’t really worry too much about that.</p></li>
<li><p>Layout calculations are performed on a background thread, the so-called ‘shadow’ thread. This can make a big
difference when e.g. scrolling through a large complex list view.</p>

<p>Granted, you <em>can</em> do this with <code>UIView</code>, but the pattern is not as ingrained in UIKit thus usually leading to more holistic
replacements such as <a href="http://asyncdisplaykit.org">AsyncDisplayKit</a>.</p></li>
<li><p>Great separation of declarative view layout (JS, single-threaded) and technical details (native code, multi-threaded).
Because of the hard constraint of having a JS/native bridge, there really is no way to take shortcuts (e.g. spaghetti
code) that in the long run would only lead to technical debt. Constraints are great.</p></li>
<li><p>Because there’s very little code that needs to be compiled and how the isolated component nature of React makes it
it very easy to reload code in-process, development velocity lies much higher than with your typical native UIKit-based
development.</p></li>
<li><p>While, as mentioned above, there are definitely issues with the tooling and libs, on the flip-side it is all
open-source software and you <em>can</em> (officially) dive in and figure it out, unlike e.g. Xcode and UIKit. (Granted, you
still need to deal with these when using React Native, but it can be kept to a minimal surface.)</p></li>
<li><p>Because React Native is still young, fast moving, and open-source, this is a great time to help shape the framework
you’d <em>want</em> to use.</p></li>
</ul>


<a name="Things.we.learned"></a>
<h1>Things we learned</h1>

<ul>
<li><p>When we started out with React Native, I didn't want to have to re-write our application in order to take advantage of
the technology. To address this I worked within our existing application structure. We consider the App to
<a href="https://artsy.github.io/blog/2015/08/24/Cocoa-Architecture-Hybrid-Apps/">be a browser</a> of native and web view controllers. So,
we added routes <a href="http://artsy.github.io/blog/2015/08/19/Cocoa-Architecture-Switchboard-Pattern/">to our SwitchBoard</a> for
view controllers which are created in React Native. To the rest of the app, there is no difference between a Swift view controller,
or one with React Native inside.</p></li>
<li><p>All of the React Native code is kept in a completely separate repo, <a href="https://github.com/artsy/emission">Emission</a>, which
when deployed generates a minified version of the JavaScript. This means to build the Artsy iOS app you do not need to have
a JavaScript development environment.</p></li>
<li><p>We reused a lot of our existing native views, starting with loading indicators and native switch views.</p></li>
<li><p>We used new native classes to improve integration, for example the <code>&lt;OpaqueImageView&gt;</code>
<a href="https://github.com/artsy/emission/blob/master/lib/components/opaque_image_view.js">component</a> is a
<a href="https://github.com/artsy/emission/tree/master/Pod/Classes/OpaqueImageViewComponent">native</a> <code>UIImageView</code>
subclass that works with our application-wide <a href="https://cocoapods.org/pods/SDWebImage">SDWebImage</a> image cache.</p></li>
</ul>


<a name="Conclusion"></a>
<h1>Conclusion</h1>

<p>To really shine with React Native, you need native experience. JavaScript has not eaten everything yet. However,
you don't need a team of native experts. For example, we expect to be able to get quite far with Android support based on
our work in React Native, but to make it amazing, we will need someone with history and context in the space.</p>

<p>This frees up our engineers to widen their <a href="https://artsy.github.io/blog/2016/01/30/iOS-Junior-Interviews/">T-shaped skills</a>,
and to help remove the idea that the mobile team has to be a completely separate team with foreign tools and ideas.</p>

    <link href="http://artsy.github.io/blog/2016/06/27/dependency-injection-in-swift/"/>
    <updated>2016-06-27T12:00:00+00:00</updated>
    <id>http://artsy.github.io/blog/2016/06/27/dependency-injection-in-swift</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Dependency Injection (DI) is a <a href="http://www.jamesshore.com/Blog/Dependency-Injection-Demystified.html">$25 word for a 5¢ idea</a>, but it's an idea that has become wholly foundation to how I write software. I want to take a look at some of the ways our team have been using DI in Swift.</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>DI users in Swift (and Objective-C) are generally in one of a few camps:</p>

<ul>
<li>Use <a href="https://www.natashatherobot.com/unit-testing-swift-dependency-injection/">initializer injection</a> to provide objects with their dependencies.</li>
<li>Use property injection (<a href="https://ashfurrow.com/blog/lazy-property-setup-in-swift/">with laziness even!</a>).</li>
<li>Use <a href="https://github.com/Swinject/Swinject">frameworks like Swinject</a> to build dependency graphs at run time.</li>
</ul>


<p>If you've used storybards or nibs before, you have probably already used property injection via IBOutlets. I actually consider initializer injection and property injection to be roughly the equivalent, just with different timing.</p>

<p>If I had to pick a favourite, I like the initializer injection because it fits appropriately with the level of dynamism Swift offers. But Swift is still <em>super</em> young and there're lots of programming techniques to explore, so I've been experimenting with something new.</p>

<p>The idea is similar to initializer injection, where you provide an instance's dependencies, but instead of providing the dependencies directly, you provide closures that return a dependency. It sounds odd, and is best explained using an example that starts without any DI at all.</p>

<p>Okay, we've got a network layer that communicates with an API. We're writing the class that takes the parsed data from the <code>NetworkProvider</code> class and turns it into models consumable by the rest of the app. Right now it looks like this.</p>

<pre><code class="swift">class StateManager {
    let networkProvider: NetworkProvider

    init() {
        networkProvider = NetworkProvider("https://api.wherever.com")
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>There are some limitations to this, specifically around testing it. It would be better to have the <code>networkProvider</code> passed in as an argument to <code>init()</code>. That's initializer injection, and my opposition to it is that we've moved the responsibility for creating the <code>networkProvider</code> up the stack.</p>

<pre><code class="swift">class StateManager {
    let networkProvider: NetworkProvider

    init(networkProvider: NetworkProvider) {
        self.networkProvider = networkProvider
    }
}

...

let stateManager = StateManager(
    networkProvider: NetworkProvider("https://api.wherever.com")
    )
</code></pre>

<p>The thing is, now some <em>other</em> object has to know how to do create the <code>NetworkProvider</code>. Hrm. You can repeat this process of injecting dependencies from further up the stack until you have a general-purpose DI framework, and that's not my bag.</p>

<p>My approach passes a closure that <em>returns</em> a network provider instead of passing in a <code>networkProvider</code> instance directly. The parameter can be given a default implementation, too.</p>

<pre><code class="swift">class StateManager {
    let networkProvider: NetworkProvider

    init(
        networkProviderCreator: () -&gt; NetworkProvider = StateManager.defaultNetworkCreator()
        ) {
        networkProvider = networkProviderCreator()
    }

    class func defaultNetworkCreator() -&gt; (() -&gt; NetworkProvider) {
        return {
            NetworkProvider("https://api.wherever.com")
        }
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>There's a lot to unpack here, so let's take it slowly. The initializer has a new <code>networkProviderCreator</code>, a closure that returns a <code>NetworkProvider</code>. In the initializer, we set our property to the return value of the closure. We also have a class method that gives us a default implementation that's used in production.</p>

<p>But in tests, we can initialize the <code>StateManager</code> with a stub closure, something like:</p>

<pre><code class="swift">let fakeNetworkProvider = ...
let testSubject = StateManager({ fakeNetworkProvider })
</code></pre>

<p>Now you get the benefits of initializer injection, but the flexibility to only use DI when you need to.</p>

<p>Note: we should still test the <code>defaultNetworkCreator()</code> function to make sure it works, too. Having code behave differently specifically while being tested is not generally a good idea.</p>

<p>Applying the advice on using <code>typealias</code> from <a href="http://artsy.github.io/blog/2016/06/24/typealias-for-great-good/">my last post</a>, we can tidy our code up a little bit.</p>

<pre><code class="swift">class StateManager {
    typealias NetworkCreator: () -&gt; NetworkProvider

    let networkProvider: NetworkProvider

    init(
        networkProviderCreator: NetworkCreator = StateManager.defaultNetworkCreator()
        ) {
        networkProvider = networkProviderCreator()
    }
}

private typealias ClassFunctions = StateManager
extension ClassFunctions {
    class func defaultNetworkCreator() -&gt; NetworkCreator {
        return {
            NetworkProvider("https://api.wherever.com")
        }
    }
}
</code></pre>

<a name="But.wait..there.s.more."></a>
<h3>But wait, there's more!</h3>

<p>The other benefits of passing in a closure instead of an instance is that it lets the initializer customize the dependency based on other data. For example, let's say the state manager uses an <code>enum</code> to differentiate between staging and production API endpoints (btw, <a href="https://ashfurrow.com/blog/the-wrong-binary/">two-case enums are great at this</a>). How might our initializer change?</p>

<pre><code class="swift">enum APIEnvironment {
    case Staging, Production
}

class StateManager {
    typealias NetworkCreator: (String) -&gt; NetworkProvider

    let networkProvider: NetworkProvider

    init(
        environment: APIEnvironment,
        networkProviderCreator: NetworkCreator = StateManager.defaultNetworkCreator()
        ) {
        let baseURLString: String
        switch environment {
        case .Staging:
            baseURLString = "https://staging-api.wherever.com"
        case .Production:
            baseURLString = "https://api.wherever.com"
        }

        networkProvider = networkProviderCreator(baseURLString)
    }
}

private typealias ClassFunctions = StateManager
extension ClassFunctions {
    class func defaultNetworkCreator() -&gt; NetworkCreator {
        return { baseURLString in
            NetworkProvider(baseURLString)
        }
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>I really dig this. The closure to create the dependency is close to the code that uses it, but is insulated from any specific instance, so we get the benefits of using DI.</p>

<p>You could argue that picking a base URL for an API shouldn't belong here, and you could probably convince me. But my point isn't that this specific example is ideal, it's that the pattern of using closures for initializer injection is pretty neat.</p>

<p>The logic to create dependencies has to go <em>somewhere</em>. I think it makes sense to keep it close to the code that actually uses the dependency, but isolated in a <code>class</code> function so no actual instance is involved in its creation. As a result, developers get the benefits of initializer injection and none of the added cognitive overhead when writing your production code.</p>

<p>It may not be a perfect pattern (what is?) but we've been using it on <a href="https://github.com/artsy/eidolon">eidolon</a> and <a href="https://github.com/artsy/eigen">eigen</a> for nearly two years and – combined with generous use of protocols – we've been really happy with the results.</p>

<p>Now that I have more free time to explore the pattern, I want to take it a step further and see where it could be used outside of unit testing. It's possible that using this approach could make all our types less tightly coupled and provide a more modular codebase.</p>
