    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Hey all, I was asked to talk internally about ways in which anyone can improve their day-to-day computer usage. For me, using keyboard shortcuts shows a greater level of control of your machine - and more importantly can be considerably faster.</p>

<p>I have all of my notes, annotated with images inside a personal GitHub repo: <a href="https://github.com/orta/keyboard_shortcuts">orta/keyboard_shortcuts</a>. We covered:</p>

<ul>
<li>Pressing menu items via keyboard</li>
<li>Window Management</li>
<li>Text Management, e.g. jumping between words etc.</li>
<li>Searching for text</li>
<li>Taking Screenshots</li>
<li>Slack and Chrome</li>
<li>Using a Window Manager and Clipboard History Manager</li>
</ul>

To recap, Orta and I <a href="http://artsy.github.io/blog/2016/01/26/swift-at-artsy/">led a course at Artsy</a> to teach our colleagues Swift <em>last</em> August, and we're doing it again.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Last August, Orta and I <a href="http://artsy.github.io/blog/2016/01/26/swift-at-artsy/">led a course at Artsy</a> to teach our colleagues Swift. There were two parallel groups of learners: a "beginners" group who had never coded before, and an "informed" group who already knew how to code. This year, we're leading the course again with a slight twist: we're repeating the course for absolute beginners, and we're introduce a new course for anyone who completed last year's beginner course.</p>

<p>We're really excited both to help new colleagues take their first steps into programming, and to help returning colleagues continue their journey.</p>

<p>Today was lesson one of the beginner group, and I have a <a href="https://youtu.be/OLdSg0XpFqA">screen recording</a> of my walkthrough of <a href="https://github.com/artsy/Swift-at-Artsy/tree/master/Beginners/Lesson%20One">lesson one's material</a>.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Hello everyone! Orta here, over the summer I've started a series of interviews with the entire development team at Artsy. They're all on different topics, notably around technical and cultural issues. I've recorded a few of them already, and will be sporadically releasing them. I'm still getting the hang of editing and recording side of this, so give me some slack.</p>

<p>Anyway, I'm pumped to introduce the first in the series - <a href="http://craigspaeth.com/">Craig Spaeth</a>.</p>

<p>Craig has been at Artsy for 6 years, moving from the first on-site developer to Director of Web. Our interview covered how Artsy's development team has adapted over time to the changing demands of a growing company. When he joined, Artsy was 6 people, we're now at ~145 people, ~20 developers and 3 businesses.</p>

    <title type="html"><![CDATA[Code Injection for Xcode]]></title>
    <link href="http://artsy.github.io/blog/2016/03/05/iOS-Code-Injection/"/>
    <updated>2016-03-05T12:09:00+00:00</updated>
    <id>http://artsy.github.io/blog/2016/03/05/iOS-Code-Injection</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I have been writing code for roughly a decade. A large chunk of that time has been sitting waiting for my project to compile. It's a nice excuse to <a href="https://xkcd.com/303/">practice sword fighting</a> in the office, but really, deep down. It's frustrating. It's so easy to become <a href="https://xkcd.com/356/">nerd-sniped</a> when you wait for a long time.</p>

<p>As we integrate Swift into our projects, I've been seeing our compile times increase. So, I took some time to look at ways to improve this. The best option, so far, has been dynamic code injection via <a href="https://github.com/johnno1962/injectionforxcode">Injection Plugin for Xcode</a>. In a gist: This means that we don't recompile and re-launch, instead we inject new bits of code into a running application. This reduced the compile cycle on Eigen from 7 seconds to 1 second.</p>

<p>I took some time over the weekend to try and put together a video showing how I used code injection on a trivial app to create a view controller in code. It covers the technique I've <a href="https://github.com/artsy/eigen/pull/1236">started using in Eigen</a> and talks a little bit about how the pieces come together.</p>
