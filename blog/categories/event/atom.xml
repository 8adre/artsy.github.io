    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>React Native has a lot of buzz around it. It is some serious and cool tech, yet can feel like a big departure from
your native iOS codebase. At Artsy, we like it. It has been the right choice for us. We've <a href="http://artsy.github.io/search/?q=react+native">documented</a> <a href="http://artsy.github.io/series/react-native-at-artsy/">our</a>
<a href="http://artsy.github.io/blog/2016/08/15/React-Native-at-Artsy/">journey</a> and <a href="http://artsy.github.io/blog/2018/03/17/two-years-of-react-native/">reasoning</a> quite extensively, but naturally, developers around the world are still wondering
whether the trade-offs make sense to <em>their</em> team, and <em>their</em> situation.</p>

<p>Enter <a href="https://www.artsy.net/x-react-native">Artsy x React-Native</a>.</p>

<p>Who better to partner with than Facebook? We're bringing a day full of hands-on informative insight and practical
play. With the focus on what building world class applications with RN can be like.</p>

<p>We'll demo, through talks and workshops, how to add React Native bit by bit to an existing codebase, set your
tooling up for success, and create solid animations.</p>

<p>We want <a href="https://www.artsy.net/x-react-native">Artsy x React-Native</a> to be about getting you up to speed with the framework, so you can make your
own decisions going forward.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>We're a growing engineering team, and that tends to mean that people move towards being more specialized. This is
great for an individual's technical depth, but can weaken their breadth of knowledge on new technology. We want to
encourage the growth of both within our engineering team. To address this our front-end engineers worked together to
run a series of workshops for the whole engineering team.</p>

<p>We called this JavaScriptures, 6 workshop-style deep dives into the major parts of the <a href="http://artsy.github.io/blog/2017/02/05/Front-end-JavaScript-at-Artsy-2017/">Artsy JavaScript
omakase</a>. They are: React, TypeScript, Styled Components, Relay and Redux, Babel and Webpack. Today I'm
posting the <a href="https://youtu.be/k_f7Ff7bREc">recording</a> and <a href="https://speakerdeck.com/artsyopensource/javascriptures-1-react">slides</a> from a deep dive into React hosted by <a href="https://twitter.com/lucsucces">Luc Succes</a> and
myself.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://www.c4q.nyc">C4Q is</a> C4Q is a non-for-profit hacker school based in NYC. We've had members of the Artsy team help out by being TAs, running committees and steering the curriculum as Engineers in the industry for many years. In 2017, C4Q reached out to arrange a meetup between Artsy engineers and students who were learning Android and Web development. This year we ran a panel for the other half of the C4Q students who study iOS and Web.</p>

<p>We got an entirely new set of panelists to cover similar topics as <a href="/blog/2017/10/10/C4Q-QandA/">last time</a> - so if you're wondering
what it's like in the industry, and what makes an Artsy engineer. The video is after the link.</p>
