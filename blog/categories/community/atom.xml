    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>At Artsy, sharing knowledge is heavily encouraged and so we write our code in the open, document using blog posts, and speak about our experiences. Many have <a href="https://twitter.com/qnoid/status/702955785064677376">bumped into us</a> at various places around the world. And so I often get the question: ‚ÄúHow did you get started? I‚Äôm interested in speaking too‚Äù.</p>

<p>In the name of sharing experiences with others, I can‚Äôt encourage this enough. Unfortunately though, public speaking is still considered <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2014/10/30/clowns-are-twice-as-scary-to-democrats-as-they-are-to-republicans/">man‚Äôs biggest fear</a>.</p>

<p>I‚Äôd like to share with you the benefits of public speaking, tips on how to get started, and how to give great presentations.</p>

<!-- more -->


<h2>Why do it?</h2>

<h3>Communication</h3>

<p>Without necessarily realising, you‚Äôre publicly speaking all the time. At the heart of it, it‚Äôs the act of communicating and expressing your ideas and viewpoints for others to understand.</p>

<p>It could be as simple as ordering your morning coffee or as important as trying to convince your team that they should use a new technology. Regardless of the context, it involves restructuring your thoughts into words and metaphors that you think others can relate to in order for them to understand your concepts.</p>

<p><strong>Public speaking is a skill that is always good to improve on</strong>. Misunderstandings happen all the time, and at the heart of that is often poor communication.</p>

<p>I know people have refrained from speaking up in meetings at work, because they struggle with speaking in front of others. There‚Äôs no need for everyone to be a keynote speaker at a conference, but if it‚Äôs hindering you in your career, it may be worth practicing. Everyone should feel empowered to call a meeting, participate in discussions, or ask questions at an all hands.</p>

<h3>Learning</h3>

<p>Another reason giving talks is üëçüèΩ is that it will allow you to learn more fully. One of the best ways to learn is by <a href="http://ideas.time.com/2011/11/30/the-protege-effect/">teaching others</a>. You grasp ideas better yourself and in order to communicate them properly, you get into the habit of restructuring your ideas and concepts.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, people often also consider this the blocker to public speaking. Not only are you afraid you‚Äôll accidentally make a fool of yourself (‚Äúwhat if I trip?‚Äù) but also that it will be apparent that you don‚Äôt know something well enough. The only way to get over this is by doing it.</p>

<p>Chances are that you are actually very knowledgeable in certain fields, you just perceive that as normal. ‚ÄúYeah, but that‚Äôs not interesting‚Ä¶ everyone knows about <em>that</em>‚Äù. And I can bet that, well, probably not everyone knows about that. Definitely not as much as you might actually do.</p>

<p>We all have our strengths. This is the time to play on them. We can‚Äôt be experts in both Core Image, Core Animation, and the Objective C runtime, all the while knowing everything about Swift Protocols. Pick your slice from a much wider scope. It doesn‚Äôt need to be a full framework, even just a specific use case of it, like <a href="https://realm.io/news/gwendolyn-weston-ios-background-networking/">background transfer services</a>.</p>

<p>Furthermore, see it as a learning opportunity. Speak about a topic that truly interests you and take this time to uncover things you‚Äôve always wanted to know. It does not require you to be an expert up front ‚Äî sharing knowledge gives you the chance to become one.</p>

<p>For example, I wanted to give a talk on the beauty of design and why beautiful things ‚Äújust work‚Äù. I took this chance to read papers and books on the field of positive psychology and design, learning all kinds of fun new facts. Others have shared with me also that it wasn‚Äôt until they decided to write or speak about certain API that they fully got to understand all the ins and outs.</p>

<h2>Ok you got me interested‚Ä¶ now what?</h2>

<p>That's great!</p>

<p>Next you'd probably want to figure out where you'd like to speak and how to prepare a good talk. This will be covered in the next two posts, so stay tuned.</p>

    <updated>2015-08-10T10:57:00+00:00</updated>
    <id>http://artsy.github.io/blog/2015/08/10/peer-lab</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>When I was living in Amsterdam, I participated in plenty of <a href="https://appsterdam.rs">Appsterdam</a> events. Things like the weekly Meeten en Drinken. I even helped lead a class in Swift. One of the events I liked the most was called Peer Lab, organized every Saturday morning by <a href="https://twitter.com/samuelgoodwin">Samuel Goodwin</a>.</p>

<p>The idea of Peer Lab is pretty simple, but also somewhat profound: developers gather in a physical space to work on things. If someone has a question, they ask the group. If you can help, you offer assistance. The goal is to foster a collaborative learning environment where everyone feels fulfilled.</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>Samuel held Peer Lab on Saturday mornings to dissuade recruiters from attending. The caf√© where we met had wifi and good coffee, which is all you really need when you're trying to get something accomplished on a Saturday morning.</p>

<p></div></div><a href='http://photos.ashfurrow.com/autumn-in-amsterdam'><img src="/images/2015-08-10-peer-lab/amsterdam.jpg" title="Amsterdam" ></a><div class='meta-container'><header>&nbsp;</header></div><div class='date-container'>&nbsp;</div><div class='content-container'><div class='entry-content'></p>

<p>Before I moved to New York, I talked to Orta about organizing something similar at the Artsy offices. He was very receptive and excited to see it happen. I would be there every Saturday from 10:30-12:30 to host, and Artsy would provide the space, the wifi, and some free coffee and snacks. Pretty minimal costs. Orta offered the <a href="http://www.meetup.com/CocoaPods-NYC/events/222362372/">CocoaPods NYC meetup group</a> as a place to promote the event. We've also been mentioning it to people we meet at other tech events in New York.</p>

<p>It's been about six months, and I feel that the Peer Lab has been a fantastic success. Every week, I get to meet developers ‚Äì some regulars and some newcomers. We sit around, talk shop, code, and hang out until pizza arrives for lunch.</p>

<p>From my perspective, it's been great. I get to meet other developers in a really chill setting, and it gets me out of the house early on Saturday. It sets an awesome tone for the rest of the weekend.</p>

<p></div></div><a href='https://instagram.com/p/5dlU_MyORN/'><img src="/images/2015-08-10-peer-lab/coffee.jpg" title="Nothing like a cup of coffee" ></a><div class='meta-container'><header>&nbsp;</header></div><div class='date-container'>&nbsp;</div><div class='content-container'><div class='entry-content'></p>

<p>Everyone seems to have a good time ‚Äì people meet, chat, work away on their projects or open source or whatever. Attendance includes iOS experts, iOS beginners, and everyone in between. Non-iOS developers are always welcome, but the CocoaPods branding ‚Äì and the network of people Orta and I know ‚Äì make it somewhat iOS-centric. We're working on that.</p>

<p>We've been doing our best to create an inclusive environment, with an emphasis placed on <a href="http://cocoapods.org/legal">CocoaPods' Code of Conduct</a>. Importantly, the event creates a space where developers can meet, work, and socialize outside of the regular alcohol-soaked meetup scene. There's nothing wrong with booze at tech meetups, but it's nice to have a space where people can socialize outside that context.</p>

<p>The Peer Lab is a cost-effective way for Artsy to get respect from the NYC developer scene. This is good for <a href="http://ashfurrow.com/blog/sharing-is-selfish/">all manner of reasons</a>, and it only costs a pizza every week.</p>

<p></div></div><a href='https://instagram.com/p/31tKTiGZVC/'><img src="/images/2015-08-10-peer-lab/classroom.jpg" width="1280" title="The Classroom at Artsy" ></a><div class='meta-container'><header>&nbsp;</header></div><div class='date-container'>&nbsp;</div><div class='content-container'><div class='entry-content'></p>

<p>So I'm happy, the people who attend are happy, and Artsy is happy.</p>

<p>But there's a problem.</p>

<p>Not everyone can make it to Artsy's lower Manhattan office every Saturday morning. Some developers live too far away, or have family/work obligations Saturday morning.</p>

<p>...</p>

<p>I want to see more Peer Labs pop up across New York, and across the world. I want you, reader, to consider starting one. It's super easy to do, I promise!</p>

<p>You don't even need a company or sponsor to organize something like this. You'll be surprised how easy it is.</p>

<p>I have a few friends living near Toronto that get together weekly at a caf√© to work together. They tweet about it and invite others. It's nothing formal, but it's valuable time for them.</p>

<p>A Peer Lab by any other name is still an awesome idea.</p>

<p>If you <em>are</em> a company, and you're looking for an easy way to meet talented developers, hosting or sponsoring a Peer Lab is definitely worth considering. There are a <em>tonne</em> of meetups in tech, but most revolve around evening drinks, maybe pizza, maybe a talk. A Peer Lab can help you stand out ‚Äì even people who don't attend are thinking "oh, that's cool."</p>

<p>Nice job, company.</p>

<p></div></div><a href='https://instagram.com/p/yNNXtKJqrk/'><img src="/images/2015-08-10-peer-lab/couch.jpg" width="1280" title="Bart the Art Plant" ></a><div class='meta-container'><header>&nbsp;</header></div><div class='date-container'>&nbsp;</div><div class='content-container'><div class='entry-content'></p>

<p>How to Peer Lab in four simple steps:</p>

<ol>
<li><strong>Pick a Time</strong>. When are <em>you</em> free to do this? Do you like working in the evenings? Awesome! Do it then. Are Sunday afternoons your jam? Sweet. Whenever works for you.</li>
<li><strong>Find a Space</strong>. This is easier than it sounds, trust me. As an organizer, you need a space that's convenient <em>for you</em>. I use my workplace because I live nearby. Samuel used a caf√© by his apartment. Anywhere that has wifi. Pick a place that works for your time ‚Äì for example, if you're meeting in the morning, a place with coffee is a good idea.</li>
<li><strong>Let the World Know</strong>. Tweet it, send it to some friends, whatever works. You could ask your employer to pay for a Meetup account. Send details to popular developers in your city and ask them to help spread the word üéâ</li>
<li><strong>Show Up</strong>. Most of success is just showing up. At the very least, you've got a nice time to jam every week, and hopefully you'll meet some other people to jam with.</li>
</ol>


<p>Keep things as simple as possible so Peer Lab stays something fun that you look forward to, and doesn't become a chore. Like I said, six months in and I still love it.</p>

<hr />

<p>Peer Lab is a fun and rewarding activity. From my perspective, from attendees' perspectives, and from Artsy's perspective. It's simply awesome.</p>

<p>Whether you're a developer or a company, an expert or a beginner, I highly encourage you to start one of your own.</p>
