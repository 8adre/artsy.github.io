    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Email! Electronic mail! What a concept! Like many companies, Artsy has built products on top of email, but this is
a decision that (like many companies) Artsy periodically regrets. But overall, our email systems work well!</p>

<p>But what about when it doesn't? Well that's what today's blog post is about: what happens when things break and you
don't know why?</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>I have learned a lot
<a href="https://artsy.github.io/blog/2018/05/30/my-first-week-on-call/">since my first on-call shift</a>, but going on call
still gives me a little stage fright. As I start a shift, I'm on the look-out for things that might break, and soon
after starting a recent on-call shift, "breaking" is exactly what things did.</p>

<p><img src="/images/2019-11-07-diagnosing-our-radiation-problems/alert.png" alt="Screenshot of Slack alert" /></p>

<p>We got an automated alert on Slack that one of our email services, code-named "Radiation", had really high response
times. We <em>then</em> received an alert that too many requests to Radiation were failing completely. Yikes. The next
twenty two hours was a deep dive into Heroku, New Relic, Rails, and PostgreSQL, all to isolate the problem and
produce a solution.</p>

<p>The nice thing about email, as a protocol, is that it's based on a store-and-forward concept. That means that if a
message delivery fails, email servers will try again later (typically with an exponential backoff). SendGrid, our
email processor, has built their REST API around this same store-and-forward concept. While the Radiation server
was unresponsive, SendGrid wouldn't receive successful HTTP responses from the webhook deliveries, so it would
attempt to re-deliver the failing emails later. Email deliveries would be delayed, but the emails themselves would
not be dropped. We wasted no time addressing the problem, but we were also confident that once we fixed the issue,
the data would be okay.</p>

<p>After the alert, Ashkan (Radiation's point-person) and I communicated with our colleagues (engineers and affected
non-engineers) about the problem. With the help of Chung-Yi, we began investigating the immediate problem (with a
focus on <em>mitigating</em> it, rather than necessarily <em>fixing</em> it). Oh, we tried it all: spinning up more Heroku Dynos
to handle requests, increasing concurrency on the individual Dynos, restarting Redis and PostgreSQL stores. Each
time, things would work briefly before the Radiation API would begin timing out again. More accurately, the
requests sent to Radiation were taking longer than the Heroku router was giving them (30 seconds) before the router
gave up and timed out the request. We started examining the Radiation code and database (keeping our <em>ion the
prize</em>: mitigation).</p>

<p>Ashkan investigated slow database queries. We added new PostgreSQL indexes to speed up queries, and restructured
others to avoid expensive joins. Unfortunately, all this accomplished was extending the time after a Dyno reboot
that things would work (before beginning to timeout again). Because
<a href="https://artsy.github.io/blog/2017/05/30/database-encryption/">Artsy stores emails as encrypted-at-rest</a>, it was
difficult to pinpoint which exact message could be causing the timeouts. And Radiation itself didn't have much in
the way of logging, which would normally help us debug the problem.</p>

<p>It was frustrating to try to fix something but only manage to improve how long it took to break again. We had
enhanced Radiation's performance to the point where it was taking 10 minutes after a Dyno reboot to begin timing
out again, up from 30 seconds at the beginning of the incident. Despite an afternoon and evening spent trying to
fix the problem, we were stuck. We decided that the best course of action was a good night's sleep; we would ask
for help in the morning.</p>

<p>The next day, Ashkan and I got <em>up and atom</em> to address the problem. We brought my on-call partner Devon up to
speed, detailing the incident symptoms and what we had tried so far. While Devon and Ashkan worked on additional
logging and new timeout strategies, I took another approach.</p>

<p>Artsy has been moving to <a href="https://www.datadoghq.com">DataDog</a> for server performance monitoring, but Radiation was
still using <a href="https://newrelic.com">New Relic</a>. My background is in iOS app development and I had never really dug
into New Relic before, but I <em>am</em> very experienced at profiling iOS applications, and the Ruby and Objective-C
runtimes have more in common than they have have differences. I used New Relic to profile a production Radiation
Dyno for five minutes and, to our collective surprise, we found that more than 90% of CPU time was being spent in
<a href="https://github.com/thoughtbot/griddler/blob/ff2ad16949bf5190f93df1a3e83eb0192f136c6d/app/controllers/griddler/emails_controller.rb#L4-L10">an innocuous function of a dependency</a>,
the open source library <a href="https://github.com/thoughtbot/griddler">Griddler</a>.</p>

<p>Artsy uses Griddler to parse and sanitize emails that we receive from <a href="https://sendgrid.com">SendGrid</a>. Griddler
contained the problematic code, which was responsible for parsing email responses from threaded replies. So if an
email body received by Radiation looks like this:</p>

<pre><code>This is the most recent reply in this email conversation.

On September 28th, 2019, Someone Else Wrote:

[The rest of the email thread]
</code></pre>

<p>Then Griddler parses out the string "This is the most recent reply in this email conversation." for Radiation to
process. This is really important because some of the threads in Radiation are <em>thousands</em> of emails long. In fact,
I learned that Radiation has Artsy's largest production database.</p>

<p>Griddler does this processing via regular expressions. Ashkan had the insight to look for existing issues from
other Griddler users who ran into similar problems, and to our delight,
<a href="https://github.com/thoughtbot/griddler/pull/310">we found a pull request</a> that appeared to address the <em>exact</em>
issue that we were having.</p>

<p>It turns out that emails with large amounts of repeated newline characters would totally stall Griddler's regex.
Heroku's router would timeout any request after 30 seconds, but would leave the Ruby code churning on that regex.
That would leave the Rails server unable to respond to subsequent HTTP requests, causing more timeouts. And because
of email's store-and-forward nature, SendGrid would begin sending more problematic emails pretty quickly after any
Radiation reboot. A small change to add a regex group was all that was necessary to fix the issue.</p>

<p>Phew! We forked Griddler to Artsy's GitHub organization and applied the change from the pull request. We were
concerned about security implications of using a different regex, but my
<a href="https://artsy.github.io/blog/2018/02/06/apogee-technical-retrospective/">previous work in regular expressions</a>
helped me vet the change. We pointed Radiation's Gemfile to Artsy's fork and deployed the change.</p>

<p><img src="/images/2019-11-07-diagnosing-our-radiation-problems/heroku.png" alt="Screenshot of Heroku Dashboard, indicating a drop in load" /></p>

<p>Then, we waited. Would the system start timing out again? It took a half hour for any of us to breathe a sigh of
relief. But things appeared to be stable: response times were normal and Dyno load dropped precipitously. Our
<em>Curie</em> worked. (Okay, enough radiation puns.)</p>

<p>During our weekly incident review, Devon guided the rest of our team through our incident response and what we
learned. Radiation is now in a much better state, so that future problems will be easier to track down. We
responded to the Griddler pull request, encouraging the maintainers to merge the commit so other teams would avoid
this problem. The incident review meeting explored a number of options to mitigate future issues, including
migrating Radiation to our Kubernetes cluster, and Sam (our VP of Engineering) suggested writing this post. So here
we are.</p>

<p>Ashkan also followed up with peer feedback for Devon, Chung-Yi, and myself. In part, it read:</p>

<blockquote><p>It's rare and odd to say dealing with incident was fun, but with your help it actually was productive and fun.</p></blockquote>

<p>Which, honestly? One of my proudest accomplishments at Artsy.</p>

<p>In the end, we solved the problem and restored access to our email systems in under 24 hours. We kept our cool, we
communicated effectively with our non-engineering colleagues, and we learned a lot. What more could you want from a
Radiation incident?</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The Artsy Vanguard is an annual editorial series where we feature up-and-coming, notable, and praiseworthy artists
and their contributions to the art world. 2019 was the second year that Artsy published this special feature,
although we have been publishing custom editorial segments multiple times per year since 2015.</p>

<p><em>In this post, I’ll discuss my recent experience working on the
<a href="https://www.artsy.net/series/artsy-vanguard-2019">2019 Artsy Vanguard</a> editorial feature. I’ll start by
introducing the technology stack behind our articles and then discuss what I learned from both a team/organization
and technical perspective.</em></p>

<a name="An.Introduction.to.Artsy.Editorial"></a>
<h1>An Introduction to Artsy Editorial</h1>

<p>Typically our editorial works fall under one of five or so categories:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.artsy.net/article/artsy-editorial-hip-hop-legend-q-tip-shares-diverse-art-collection">Standard articles</a>,
which have the same layout, but whose content could broadly relate to any of the primary categories Artsy’s
editors tend to cover.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.artsy.net/news">News content</a> consisting of an infinitely scrolling feed of the latest newsworthy
events in the art world.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.artsy.net/series/artsy-editors-future-art">Sponsored</a> and non-sponsored editorial features that may
be a <a href="https://www.artsy.net/article/artsy-editorial-rise-fall-internet-art-communities">standalone</a> publication
or a <a href="https://www.artsy.net/series/how-to-be-an-artist">part of a larger related series</a> of features.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.artsy.net/series/artsy-editors-future-art-carrie-mae-weems">Video editorial series</a>.</li>
</ul>


<p>For more information on Artsy's editorals, check out this
<a href="https://artsy.github.io/blog/2019/03/05/custom-editorial-features/">blog post</a> written by Senior Software Engineer
<a href="https://artsy.github.io/author/eve/">Eve Essex</a>.</p>

<p>To maintain consistency and standardization in terms of user experience design, layout, and page interactivity
options of the editorials that we offer, we use an internal content management service.
<a href="http://pages.artsy.net/rs/609-FDY-207/images/Gallery%20Guide%20to%20Artsy%20Writer.pdf">Artsy Writer</a> enables our
editorial team to publish content to the main Artsy website without having to collaborate with our engineering
organization. (Yay software!) Given that it is designed to handle the layout of the different types of editorial
features that we offer in a uniform way, highly customized editorials like the
<a href="https://www.artsy.net/series/artsy-vanguard-2019">2019 Artsy Vanguard</a> or
<a href="https://www.artsy.net/article/artsy-editorial-people-defined-visual-culture-2018">2018 Year in Visual Culture</a>
require quite a bit of planning and cross-team collaboration, as well as customized software development to support
the features that deviate from our current layouts.</p>

<p>Creating the 2019 Artsy Vanguard was truly a company-wide effort! I’m pretty new to Artsy, having only joined last
summer, so some of the work I did on Artsy Vanguard was around understanding our existing framework for routing
article content from <a href="https://github.com/artsy/positron">Positron</a>, Artsy’s editorial API, to
<a href="https://github.com/artsy/force">Force</a>, the code that powers our <a href="https://www.artsy.net/">production site</a>. On the
Engineering side, I collaborated with the project’s technical lead Eve, a senior engineer with years of experience
working in these code repositories. There were several key stakeholders, including, but certainly not limited to, a
lead project manager, lead visuals editor, designers, content writers, as well as the
<a href="http://wax-studios.com/">external design firm</a> that delivered the initial design concept and video content used
for the series.</p>

<a name="Learnings"></a>
<h1>Learnings</h1>

<p>Vanguard was an exciting project, but as with any software endeavor, it came with its own share of learnings and
difficulties.</p>

<a name="L.strong.1..Splitting.time.between.two.teams.is.hard..strong."></a>
<h2><strong>1. Splitting time between two teams is hard</strong></h2>

<p>My team, Grow, is responsible for the development and maintenance of Engineering software related to increasing
user engagement with Artsy’s products. Some of our most notable projects include
<a href="http://files.artsy.net/documents/artsy-bmw-city-guide.pdf">City Guide</a>, an iOS feature built in collaboration with
BMW, detailing art shows and partner fairs in several major international cities,
<a href="https://www.artsy.net/collections">collections</a> and <a href="https://www.artsy.net/collect">collection hubs</a> offering
prospective art buyers more comprehensive ways to explore works and artists of interest, and of course the
<a href="https://www.artsy.net/articles">Artsy Editorial</a>, home to all of our editorial content. We typically work in
two-week sprint cycles, aiming to produce a planned set of deliverables during that time, and collaborating between
other developers on the team, a designer, product manager, data scientist, and technical team leader.</p>

<p>Given that this project involved collaboration from several teams and stakeholders outside of Engineering, we
decided to manage it as a project separate from the rest of the deliverables the Grow team did during the sprints.
This meant I had to split my time between team meetings for Vanguard work and team meetings for Grow. I would keep
the Grow team up to date on the Vanguard work we were doing but it felt like I was in a liminal space between the
two teams. In addition to attending weekly cross-team Vanguard standups, I attended daily Vanguard engineering
standups to align with Eve on the work that we needed to produce. In the interest of protecting my time and not
attending 3 different team standups in a single day, I posted updates to the Grow team via Slack to keep everyone
updated on the progress of our work. Despite our best intentions, it’s difficult to work on two teams at once and
feel fully committed to either.</p>

<a name="L.strong.2..Estimation.is.Hard..strong."></a>
<h2><strong>2. Estimation is Hard</strong></h2>

<p>Due to the way this project was organized, we allotted 1.5 sprint cycles to complete the engineering work. However,
this time allotment was decided on before we had received the completed design specifications from the design firm.
This posed a set of interesting challenges in the sense that the Grow team committed to delivering a feature by a
predetermined deadline without having all of the information needed to understand the full scope of the project. As
with any engineering project, there are often unknown unknowns, those pesky little gotchas that surface as work
commences on a project, but that cannot always be predicted. This presented an interesting lesson in learning how
to estimate the amount of work required to deliver a minimum viable product and reduce the scope to meet certain
deadlines.</p>

<p>Given the limited amount of time to deliver some fairly complex designs, it was clear that we would have to reduce
some of the technical complexity in order to meet the deadline. This is pretty standard in agile development, but
this was the first time that I was in a position of having to deliver this "bad news". It is difficult to tell team
members that a feature is not going to be able to shipped as initially expected, but these are the sort of
concessions that have to be made sometimes in order to deliver a viable product. Fortunately, I was fully supported
by my managers, tech lead, and colleagues in having to deliver the news that we were not going to be able to
deliver a feature identical to the one given to us by the design firm. From this experience, I learned that making
accurate estimations about how much work a project actually involves is hard, relying on agile as a rule makes it
easier, communicating early and often when there’s any uncertainty around delivering a feature by deadline is
critical, and working with team members that value candor, flexibility, communication, and iteration is empowering.</p>

<a name="L.strong.3..CSS.is.Hard..strong."></a>
<h2><strong>3. CSS is Hard</strong></h2>

<p>I get excited about implementing visually delightful designs, and Artsy Vanguard’s 2019 designs did not
disappoint. There were two key components that involved interesting CSS approaches:</p>

<p><strong> 1. Mixed Blending Mode to handle the inversion of the side frame text when it appeared over different
backgrounds</strong></p>

<p><strong> 2. Creating the visual effect of <code>.mp4</code> videos nested inside of SVG shapes</strong></p>

<a name="Mixed.Blend.Mode"></a>
<h2>Mixed Blend Mode</h2>

<p>Mixed blend mode is a CSS property that handles blending the colors of overlapping elements. In this case, we
wanted to create the effect of inverting the colors of the static side frame text when they overlapped with either
the white background, the black SVG shapes, or the SVG videos.</p>

<p>This inverted color effect also needed to be applied to the text of the editorial content when it overlapped with
the black SVG background, when it extended past the SVG background onto a white background, and when the current
article was in an expanded state.</p>

<p>I found <a href="https://css-tricks.com/almanac/properties/m/mix-blend-mode/">CSS-Tricks</a> and the
<a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/mix-blend-mode">Mozilla Developer’s Network</a> documentation super
helpful in understanding the various blending properties. Since the designs for Vanguard involved a fairly simple
blending mode of inverting black and white, the mix-blend-mode difference property was how we created the effect of
inverting the black text against the various backgrounds it overlapped with. The blend mode property works by
calculating the rgb color value of the text, and the background-color of the underlying element, and using that
value to determine what colors to render. This inverse calculation also creates the “solarized” effect when the
black side frame text renders over the video-in-SVG.</p>

<p>In the original design specifications, the static text framing the page was intended to render black over a white
background, white over a black background, and white over the video-in-SVG. In order to achieve that effect, we
would have needed to apply the <code>difference</code> mix-blend-mode property when the text overlapped with a black or white
background, and color-dodge when it overlapped with a video-in-SVG background. However, given it is not possible to
assign multiple blending modes to a fixed element we had to deviate from the original design specifications.</p>

<p><img src="/images/2019-11-04-css-is-hard-and-vanguard-2019-learnings/mbb.png" alt="" /></p>

<pre><code class="ts">const FrameText = styled(Sans)`
  position: fixed;
  z-index: 2;
  mix-blend-mode: difference;
  color: rgb(255, 255, 255);
`
</code></pre>

<pre><code class="ts">const InvertedText = styled(Serif)` 
mix-blend-mode: \${p =&gt; (p.isMobile ? "normal" : "difference")}; 
color: rgb(255,255,255); 
will-change: color;
`
</code></pre>

<a name="Video-in-SVG"></a>
<h2>Video-in-SVG</h2>

<p>In the article series you might have noticed that each of the article subsections begins with a different polygonal
shape, which serves as a visual indicator to readers that they are viewing an article either the <em>Emerging</em>, <em>Newly
Established</em>, or <em>Getting Their Due</em> sections. You might have also noticed that each article subseries starts with
a video clip nested inside of one of these corresponding polygon shapes. These are what I refer to as video-in-SVG.
Nothing too in-depth here, but I’ll offer up the initial approach to how this effect was implemented as well as the
final solution.</p>

<p><img src="/images/2019-11-04-css-is-hard-and-vanguard-2019-learnings/getting-their-due.gif" alt="" />
<img src="/images/2019-11-04-css-is-hard-and-vanguard-2019-learnings/getting-their-due-img.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Initially, I attempted to implement this using the
<a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/SVG/Element/foreignObject">Foreign Object</a> SVG element and adding a
<a href="https://css-tricks.com/almanac/properties/c/clip-path/">Clip Path</a> CSS property with the to the div element
wrapping the video. In both approaches the video component stopped respecting the responsiveness of the page, which
created an undesirable layout effect of having a huge video on screens smaller than 600 pixels wide, and
disproportionate sizing relative to the rest of the components in the article series.</p>

<p>In order to achieve the desired effect, the component was refactored to make the SVG "blob" a sibling of the video
wrapped inside a parent div with a fixed height. The parent div received a height equal to 100% of the viewport
width divided by the video’s aspect ratio--16:9. This prevents the video from being visible outside the borders of
the SVG. Et voila!</p>

<pre><code class="ts">const SubseriesWrapper = styled(Flex)`
  flex-direction: row;
  position: relative;
  z-index: -2;
  /* 16 x 9 aspect ratio */
  height: calc(100vw * 0.56);
`
</code></pre>

<pre><code class="html">&lt;SubseriesWrapper&gt;
  &lt;SubseriesSVGWrapper&gt;
    &lt;svg viewBox="0 0 1600 900" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="FFF" width="100vw"&gt;
      &lt;path d="M0,0V900H1600V0ZM1489.83,896.43,146.61,805.5,47.2,182.84,320,4.17l874.07,86,360.06,148Z" /&gt;
    &lt;/svg&gt;
    &lt;VanguardSubseriesVideoWrapper&gt;
      &lt;VanguardSubseriesVideo autoPlay loop muted playsInline controls="{false}" src="{props.url}" /&gt;
    &lt;/VanguardSubseriesVideoWrapper&gt;
  &lt;/SubseriesSVGWrapper&gt;
&lt;/SubseriesWrapper&gt;
</code></pre>

<a name="Final.Thoughts"></a>
<h1>Final Thoughts</h1>

<p>One of the biggest non-technical takeaways for me was the importance of becoming skilled at thinking like a product
manager while approaching engineering work. Engineers that do this well are adept at balancing many
responsibilities–scoping out the amount of engineering work involved in producing a deliverable, communicating
technical information to non-technical team members, managing expectations and (sometimes) competing interests when
working on cross-teams projects, gracefully informing stakeholders that the scope of a project will have to be
limited in order to deliver an MVP, among others. Doing these things well is hard, and furthermore not something we
learn in computer science or engineering programs; yet is a requisite, in my opinion, to be an effective engineer.
I’m grateful for the opportunity to have collaborated with others on this year’s Artsy Vanguard and to have been
given the chance to develop these skills.</p>

    <link href="http://artsy.github.io/blog/2019/04/19/having-a-coffee-with-every-engineer/"/>
    <updated>2019-04-19T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
    <id>http://artsy.github.io/blog/2019/04/19/having-a-coffee-with-every-engineer</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>In early 2018, I was set to begin my fifth year working at Artsy. Something about my imminent Artsyversary had me
thinking about my role within the Engineering team. Not my role as an engineer <em>per se</em>, but my role as a
<em>colleague</em>. This is the longest I've ever worked for one company, and as Artsy started growing the team last year,
I wanted to <a href="https://github.com/artsy/README/blob/master/culture/engineering-principles.md#leverage-your-impact">leverage my impact</a> as a longtime colleague to help scale its culture.</p>

<p>Artsy collects quarterly, anonymous, company-wide surveys through <a href="https://www.cultureamp.com">Culture Amp</a> to determine how everyone is
doing. These are great for answering quantitative questions about the team, like "how engaged are we on average?",
and I always check out the breakdown of answers in the Engineering team. But there's something unsatisfying about
these reports – they're super-valuable, but they feel impersonal to me.</p>

<p>If I wanted to leverage my impact, I needed to play to my strengths and interests. I'm keenly interested in people
– as individuals – so I decided that the best way for me to contribute to the team was to get to know everyone as
individuals. To become someone the team could talk to. Someone outside the typical manager/employee structure, who
could use their history at Artsy to answer questions (or at least point them in the right direction).</p>

<p>So, I set off on a project to meet with every member of Artsy's Engineering team for a one-on-one. With no explicit
goals or expectations, but in line with Artsy's <a href="https://github.com/artsy/README/blob/master/culture/what-is-artsy.md#people-are-paramount">People are Paramount</a> value, I got to know my colleagues
better.</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>I didn't want this project to interfere with my product work, so I decided to take things slow. I started with a
list of every Artsy engineer and then removed anyone I already had a close working relationship with. Next, I
prioritized the team leads and randomized the rest of the list. I set up a recurring task (yay OmniFocus) to
schedule a coffee with an engineer every week. When we met, I'd cross them off my list.</p>

<p>That was over a year ago, so what did I learn? Well, a lot, actually! But to get a sense of the impact my project
had, you'll need some context.</p>

<p>2018 was a complex year for Artsy, where we both gained and lost more engineers than usual. The increase in
engineering turnover was generally attributable to what I'll call "cultural churn." Scaling a team comes with new
challenges, and our team leadership tried to meet those challenges with changes to the team's structure. Some of
these changes turned out to be tougher than we'd hoped. Our team is in a great spot <em>now</em>, but we didn't get from
there to here via a straight line.</p>

<p>In the midst of this cultural churn, I was trying to have a one-on-one with every engineer. I was asking
people "hey, how are you doing? Want to grab a coffee?" And that actually had a pretty big impact: if I met someone
and they told me "this situation is stressing me out" or "this feels bad", it was really validating for them to
hear me respond "yeah, I'm feeling this too. It's not just you." This dovetailed with my contemporaneous research
into <a href="https://ashfurrow.com/blog/building-better-software-by-building-better-teams/">building compassionate teams</a>, which I leveraged throughout this project.</p>

<p>Turns out: people feel better when they know the problems they have are shared by others. <em>Sharing</em> suffering is
actually one way to <em>minimize</em> suffering, and minimizing suffering is at the core of my beliefs on compassionate
teams.</p>

<p>Once I knew something was wrong with our team culture, I went to my manager to discuss the broad-strokes themes of
what I was hearing from my peers. I would never betray the confidence of a colleague, but being able to say "lots
of people are all feeling X" provided an important data point. While leadership already knew that <em>something</em> was
not quite right, this data point was a strong indicator that leadership had to intervene quickly. I'll skip the
details of how we ultimately addressed our cultural churn (tl;dr it involved our leaders asking IC's questions, and
then listening to what they had say). I'm quite happy to say that things are a lot better now!</p>

<p>While my "have a one-on-one with everyone" project obviously didn't "fix" the situation, it put me in a position to
<em>help</em> fix it. In addition to getting to know everyone as individuals, I got to help identify and help address our
cultural churn.</p>

<p>So what next? Well, a lot, actually! Even more engineers have since joined Artsy, and I admittedly haven't had a
one-on-one with all of them. But through this project, I realized that I'm very keen to do more of this kind of
people-work. When my manager recently brought up the possibility of becoming a tech lead, <a href="https://ashfurrow.com/blog/reflecting-on-5-years-at-artsy/">I jumped on the
opportunity</a>. I started last week.</p>

<p>My initial goal, to have a coffee with everyone, remains unfulfilled. It probably won't ever be, considering that I
now have even less free time in my new role. I'm not an IC anymore – my one-on-ones have to now be focused on <em>my</em>
team. While the goal of meeting everyone for a one-on-one will never be accomplished, the journey turned out to be
more important.</p>

<p>Important both to me – getting to know my colleagues (and myself!) better – but also important for the team. I got
to help our team's culture scale up, and through that experience, I found and expanded the perimeter of my sphere
of influence as an IC.</p>

<p>I can't thank Artsy enough for giving me the freedom, as an IC, to research team dynamics, to pursue this project,
and for taking all my feedback seriously. If you're a senior engineer wondering what's next, try turning your
attention to your team. I would bet that you'll learning something worthwhile.</p>

    <link href="http://artsy.github.io/blog/2019/03/12/so-you-want-to-be-an-engineer/"/>
    <updated>2019-03-12T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
    <id>http://artsy.github.io/blog/2019/03/12/so-you-want-to-be-an-engineer</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>First of all, that's very exciting! Software engineering is pretty darn cool—you get to learn lots of new things,
understand the technology you use every day better, and contribute to the mysterious maw known as "the internet".</p>

<p>Last February, I also decided that I wanted to pursue computer engineering. I'd been at Artsy for a bit less than
two years at that point, first as a marketing intern working on SEO and then as a coordinator on the CRM (read:
email) team. I'd consistently been working on small technical projects; first doing
<a href="https://github.com/artsy/positron/commit/3176282a3ea94c626e9d851b7c0dd27a1bb0fcb4">some work</a> on a tool for SEO
optimization for our Editorial team, then building
<a href="http://artsy.github.io/blog/2018/11/19/mjml/">emails with MJML</a>, and a few other bits and bobs. But I didn't think
of it as a serious pursuit.</p>

<p>Mostly, that was due to my experience programming in the past—I did about half a CS major in undergrad. At the
time, I felt that programming wasn't right for me, and I dropped the major during my third year.</p>

<p>It was Artsy's Engineering team that convinced me that programming was something that I both wanted to and could
do. Our engineers have always welcomed learners and been happy to answer questions and empower other teams to do
technical work. I eventually realized that the parts of my work where I was coding were the parts I enjoyed the
most, and that I would likely feel more fulfilled if I made programming my full-time occupation.</p>

<p>Here's what that journey looked like. Hopefully my experience proves helpful to you as you begin (or finish) yours!</p>

<!-- more -->


<a name="Step.One:.Tell.People.What.You.Want"></a>
<h1>Step One: Tell People What You Want</h1>

<p>This might've been the single biggest learning I took away from this experience: <em>if you tell people you want
something, you might just get it.</em></p>

<p>That may sound super obvious. It wasn't for me. I've usually been very passive in my career decisions, taking the
path of least resistance and considering myself lucky when I was able to keep progressing. In this case, I was
making a substantial departure from that idea by being proactive about what it was I wanted.
<a href="https://engineering.gusto.com/i-didnt-want-to-be-a-manager-anymore-and-the-world-didnt-end/">This post</a> by
<a href="https://twitter.com/NoaElad">Noa Elad</a> does a great job with this topic and is certainly worth a read.</p>

<p>The first person I told at Artsy was <a href="https://twitter.com/orta">Orta</a>. He'd often encouraged me to develop my
technical skills, and since he knows Artsy's engineering team and stack better than just about anyone, I figured
he'd be able to point me in the right direction when it came to learning resources and navigating company politics
to get to my eventual goal.</p>

<p>The second person I told was my manager on the CRM team. I fortunately had a very good relationship with my manager
and was confident that she would help me if she could. And by telling her early, I was giving her more opportunity
to advocate for me and making it easier for her to replace me in the event that I was able to switch teams.</p>

<p>The third person I told was Artsy's CTO, <a href="https://www.dblock.org/">dB</a>. This was Orta's recommendation—dB would be
able to tell me if and when a move might be possible, and he could suggest things I should do to improve my chances
of making the switch.</p>

<p>I also didn't keep it a secret from the rest of my team or the company. I didn't show up wearing a shirt that said
"ENGINEER" on it, but I told people, "I'm working on becoming an engineer. I'm really hoping to stay at Artsy, but
if there's not a role open for me, that's fine—I'll search elsewhere."</p>

<p>The net outcome of these conversations was that there wasn't a role open right then (and that I still had lot to
learn before I'd be ready when one became available), but I also left with a better idea of what I should learn and
what I could expect from the coming months.</p>

<a name="Step.Two:.Figure.Out.What.You.Want.to.Learn"></a>
<h1>Step Two: Figure Out What You Want to Learn</h1>

<p>The answer to that question really depends on who you are, where you work, and where you <em>want</em> to work.</p>

<p>I wanted to work at Artsy, and I felt that I was most interested in front-end work. So I asked a few of our
engineers to help me understand our stack and to recommend frameworks/languages I should learn.</p>

<p>If you're interested in changing companies as well as careers, it's worth seeing if your target company or
companies have open source code you can check out. See if you can find them on <a href="https://www.github.com">GitHub</a> and
look at some of their recently updated repos. If you already have some coding experience, see if you can contribute
a little bit—even fixing small bugs or typos is a good place to start, since you're both contributing to their
codebase (which will help you if you land an interview) and learning more about their stack. dB recommended that I
do this with Artsy's code.</p>

<p>As with most companies that have been around for more than a year or two, Artsy is home to projects with many
different stacks. However, most of our newer front-end stuff—things that are recently updated or currently in
development—is built on React using TypeScript. So my first question was "what do I need to know in order to write
TypeScript code in a React framework?"</p>

<p>Fortunately, a lot of other people have the same question.</p>

<a name="Step.Three:.Decide.How.You.Want.to.Learn.It"></a>
<h1>Step Three: Decide How You Want to Learn It</h1>

<p>First: <strong>there is no wrong way to go about learning to code</strong>. Whether it takes you 6 months or 6 years, whether
you learn one language or a dozen, whether you ask for a lot of help or do it all yourself, <strong>you are learning and
that is valuable</strong>. Learning to code is not a magical skill. Like just about everything, it's a matter of putting
in time. Just keep trying, even small things, and you <em>will</em> make progress.</p>

<p>Lots of people who want to become engineers go to coding bootcamps like <a href="https://flatironschool.com/">Flatiron</a> or
<a href="https://generalassemb.ly/">General Assembly</a>. That's a very reasonable thing to do! I had a decent grounding in CS
fundamentals thanks to my experience in undergrad, and as a result, I initially decided I wouldn't do a coding
bootcamp—I felt I had enough experience to benefit from the multitude of online courses and open source projects
out there.</p>

<p>However, there are definitely real and significant benefits do doing a bootcamp. Here are three that I can think
of:</p>

<ol>
<li>Clear curriculum. At times, I was overwhelmed by the possible ways to proceed and stopped making progress as a
result. Bootcamps take the guesswork out.</li>
<li>Timeline. Because I didn't have a hard date set for a transition or interview, it was up to me to determine how
fast/slow I worked on things, and I stagnated at times as a result.</li>
<li>Community. While the open source community is very much a real thing, and you can find lovely people on the
internet who want to help learners like yourself, it's not the same as having multiple people learning the same
thing at the same time in the same physical space.</li>
</ol>


<p>The downsides, of course, are that coding bootcamps are expensive and time-consuming. Most of us don't have the
luxury to leave a job, pay $10K – $15K in fees, and spend a couple months at a full-time bootcamp with no income.
There are other models, such as online-only bootcamps or after-hours classes, but those come with challenges of
their own.</p>

<p>I'd say that If you can afford a bootcamp and have the time, it's a great way to jumpstart a coding career, but you
don't have to attend one to become a good engineer.</p>

<p>If you decide to go the non-bootcamp route, you also have a lot of good options. I did courses through
<a href="https://www.udemy.com">Udemy</a>, which has a lot of courses that are literally always on sale for $10 - $20. There
are many other similar services out there as well, like <a href="https://www.udacity.com">Udacity</a>,
<a href="https://www.codecademy.com/">Codecademy</a>, and <a href="https://teamtreehouse.com/">Treehouse</a>.</p>

<p>I also highly recommend attending IRL meetups, because that's where you can make connections and learn from others
most easily. I'm a semi-regular attendee at the <a href="https://www.meetup.com/CocoaPods-NYC/">CocoaPods meetup</a> hosted by
<a href="https://twitter.com/ashfurrow">Ash</a> and Orta at Artsy HQ, and <a href="https://www.meetup.com/find/tech/">meetup.com</a> and
<a href="https://peerlab.community/">peerlab.community</a> are great places to find other events.</p>

<a name="Step.Four:.Get.Comfortable.Not.Knowing.Things"></a>
<h1>Step Four: Get Comfortable Not Knowing Things</h1>

<p>When learning engineering concepts (and practicalities), there's a lot you're not going to know.</p>

<p>This piece of advice is important both when learning and once you actually land an engineering job (it's been one
of the hardest parts of my first ~3 months on Artsy engineering).</p>

<p>Part of what makes engineering so cool is that you are always challenged to learn new things and solve new
problems. But especially at first, the mental toolbox you have is pretty limited. When you don't know a language or
framework, it's very hard to solve problems using it—your first problems are likely to be syntax errors and
misunderstandings.</p>

<p>One of the best things you can do is learn how to ask good questions and then ask them. You might be asking them on
a forum, in GitHub issues, in meetings, or in conversation with your
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rubber_duck_debugging">favorite rubber duck</a>. Regardless, just asking them will
help, and asking lots of questions is one of the best way to learn things fast—but it takes humility and
self-awareness. <a href="https://twitter.com/b0rk">Julia Evans</a> has a <a href="https://jvns.ca/wizard-zine.pdf">great zine</a> that
has good advice on asking questions, among many other things. For a few more fun and helpful resources, see
<a href="https://github.com/artsy/README/blob/master/resources/tech-learning.md">Artsy's README</a>.</p>

<a name="Step.Five:.Recognize.What.You.Bring.to.the.Table"></a>
<h1>Step Five: Recognize What You Bring to the Table</h1>

<p>Ok, so you're reconciled to the fact that you have a lot to learn—but what about all the things you already know?
Those are important too!</p>

<p>Even if your past work and/or life experience has nothing to do with computers or programming, it can still have
value as you work towards engineering (and after you become an engineer). That value can take a lot of different
forms, and since everyone's experiences are different, I can't say for sure what impact your prior knowledge will
have.</p>

<p>For me, there are a few experiences I brought to engineering that were particularly helpful. Because I was
transitioning from one team at Artsy to another (Marketing → Engineering), I brought with me a broad understanding
of Artsy's goals and needs, which helps with day-to-day prioritization. And when I'm in a sprint planning meeting
or a product review and someone has a question about email or marketing, I can often answer—or at least I know who
to talk to to get to the bottom of the issue quickly. Plus if at some point my team needs to code emails, my
<a href="http://artsy.github.io/blog/2018/11/19/mjml/">past experience</a> will come in very handy.</p>

<p>There are also life experiences that serve me well on the Engineering team. My work as a server and bartender made
me good at clear communication with stakeholders. Cooking for big groups of friends has made me better at
estimating how long I'll need for tasks. Don't underestimate the power of "soft skills"—even companies like Google
<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/answer-sheet/wp/2017/12/20/the-surprising-thing-google-learned-about-its-employees-and-what-it-means-for-todays-students">have come to recognize</a>
that it's often the non-technical skills that separate good engineers from great ones.</p>

<p>————</p>

<p>Moving to engineering has been a tricky process, but one I'm very grateful to have experienced. I'm lucky to work
at an organization where moving from email marketing to engineering is possible, and I'm even luckier to have had
the support of engineers, friends, and engineer-friends in making the move. If you end up pursuing this course as
well, I wish you the best of luck!</p>

    <link href="http://artsy.github.io/blog/2019/01/23/artsy-engineering-hiring/"/>
    <updated>2019-01-23T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
    <id>http://artsy.github.io/blog/2019/01/23/artsy-engineering-hiring</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Interviewing is hard. Interviewers want to make sure they're hiring the person who will add the most value to their
team; candidates want to make sure they're joining a company that aligns with their goals and perspectives.</p>

<p>Recent trends in hiring are white-boarding sessions, trivia questions, and hours of take-home assignments. At
Artsy, we don't use any of these. We often get asked why not - and how we assess technical skill without them.</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>We think our interview process at Artsy is unique, but we also think our interview process is great. We'd love to
see the tech community examine its hiring practices, and hopefully to adopt some of what's made our hiring process
successful. Focusing on knowledge and facts that are already acquired is one way to approach hiring; we prefer to
look at how a person can fill a gap in our team and help us grow.</p>

<p><aside>
  <div class="question">
    <h3>What surprised you about the hiring process at Artsy while you were a candidate?</h3>
  </div>
  <div class="answer">
    <img src="/images/artsy-engineering-hiring/ash.jpg">
    <p class="intro">Ash Furrow says...</p>
    <p>What most surprised me at the time was <em>who</em> was interviewing me. I had a teleconference screening with Artsy's now-CTO before moving on to in-person interviews. Since I was living in Amsterdam at the time, Artsy flew me to its nascent London office to meet two interviewers: a data engineer and a member of (what was then) the Arts team.</p>
    <p>I was surprised, but encouraged, to be speaking with someone who wasn't an engineer. They asked me questions to find out what motivated me, to evaluate how well those motivations would help Artsy achieve its mission. It was a natural fit!</p>
  </div>
  <div class="answer">
    <img src="/images/artsy-engineering-hiring/lily.jpg">
    <p class="intro">Lily Pace says...</p>
    <p>Everything. I was pleasantly surprised by how different the interview process at Artsy was from my previous experiences, which felt more like standardized tests than conversations. The underlying presumption with "traditional" tech hiring practices is that candidates are somehow trying to trick their way into positions they aren’t qualified for. It's no wonder that impostor syndrome is so prevalent in underrepresented groups when the interview process is set up like an interrogation.</p>
    <p>I felt like the interviewers at Artsy had read my resume and cv and taken it at face value, so the interview was spent diving deeper into my skill-set and personality and determining compatibility, instead of trying to identify gaps in my knowledge.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="answer">
    <img src="/images/artsy-engineering-hiring/steve.jpg">
    <p class="intro">Steve Hicks says...</p>
    <p>With 20 years (!!!) of experience as a software engineer, I've seen my share of interviews - from both sides. On the hiring side, I've said for years that technical interviews are unnecessary. If I can get a 30 minute conversation with a candidate, I feel like I can learn enough about them to know if they can do the job from a technical perspective. It's much less about knowing trivia or syntax, and much more about having the personality to solve problems.</p>
    <p>I'd never experienced that on the candidate side, though. When I did, I definitely felt like Artsy had forgotten part of the interview. Where was the whiteboard? The homework? People looking over my shoulder while I coded an anagram-checker? A technical challenge has been a part of every interview I've done as a candidate - until Artsy.</p>
  </div>
</aside></p>

<p>Artsy's process of hiring new engineers was created and is maintained <em>by</em> our current engineers. It has evolved
over time as we learn new lessons and new perspectives join our team. Our process has always been driven by a
top-down culture of respect for candidates, which aligns with
<a href="https://github.com/artsy/README/blob/master/culture/what-is-artsy.md#artsy-values">our company values</a>. Our team
currently has 36 engineers, and we refreshed our hiring practices last year to support our team's growth; we hired
a dozen engineers in 2018. We don't use recruiters (though we did to hire our recent VP of Engineering).</p>

<p>Our former Director of Web Engineering has a blog post where he
<a href="https://www.zamiang.com/post/learning-from-artsy-how-to-hire-awesome-engineers">describes Artsy's hiring process</a>.
Though some specifics have since changed, the foundations remain the same.</p>

<blockquote><p>If Artsy has a secret sauce, it is how it hires. All else falls from the assumption that they have hired the best
people who want to work together to achieve Artsy’s mission.</p></blockquote>

<p>Our hiring process starts with an informational, where candidates are met for a coffee or over a teleconference
call. We have <a href="https://github.com/artsy/README/blob/master/playbooks/informationals.md">public documentation</a> so
candidates can know what to expect. We do a lot of these and move candidates who we think would succeed at Artsy on
to in-person interviews. The interviews last 3 hours and are split across four 45-minute
<a href="https://www.livecareer.com/career/advice/interview/behavioral-interviewing">behavioral interviews</a>, conducted by
engineers and other colleagues, ranging from gallery liaisons to product managers to editorial writers. Artsy
generally, and Engineering specifically, have both significantly invested in helping interviewers be effective and
consistent; this includes documentation, question banks, and <a href="https://managingbias.fb.com">unconscious bias</a>
training.</p>

<p>Each interviewer is given key areas to focus on, based on the candidate's background. We have documentation
specifying how to evaluate each of these areas, including example questions. These areas include, but aren't
limited to:</p>

<ul>
<li>Comprehension of Artsy</li>
<li>Artsy company values alignment</li>
<li>Ability to communicate complex ideas</li>
<li>Learning and adaptation</li>
<li>Self-learning and drive</li>
<li>Independence and teamwork</li>
<li>Systems development</li>
<li>Product knowledge</li>
</ul>


<p>After the interview, feedback is written up as quickly as possible. To limit bias, interviewers can't see each
other's feedback until after they write up their own. The write-up includes a recommendation: do you think we
should move on to reference checks? Answers are either "strong yes", "yes", "no", or "strong no"; after everyone
has completed their write-ups, the interviewers debrief and reflect on how to do a better job next time. Their
feedback is used by the hiring manager to decide whether to move on to reference checks.</p>

<p>Quoting again from our former Director of Web's blog post:</p>

<blockquote><p>Artsy believes that 'references are not a defense against hiring poorly, they are a way to hire great people'.</p></blockquote>

<p>Artsy's reference checks are in-depth and deserve their own blog post; they are <em>key</em> to our hiring process. We
know that job interviewers only evaluate how good someone is at interviewing, so we put a larger emphasis than most
companies on references. The most accurate predictor of future job performance is past job performance, not how
well someone can perform in an interview.</p>

<p>If we decide to hire the candidate, we make them a job offer. Artsy offers what we think is a fair wage based on
the local market and the candidate; we do not low-ball candidates and we don't negotiate on compensation.</p>

<a name="What.s.wrong.with.typical.hiring.practices."></a>
<h2>What's wrong with typical hiring practices?</h2>

<p>There are many tactics for assessing a candidate's technical abilities, but we've found that many are unfair to the
candidate. Some strategies put unnecessary pressure on the candidate. Some select against qualified candidates who
have competing responsibilities outside work. Some unwittingly weed out underrepresented applicants, even at a time
when companies are trying to diversify their teams.</p>

<a name="In-person.coding.challenges"></a>
<h3>In-person coding challenges</h3>

<p>The intention of in-person coding challenges is to verify that the engineer can "actually write code." This
strategy puts excessive pressure on the candidate to perform in front of an audience. This is usually not a good
reflection of what the candidate would be doing if they were hired. Sometimes it <strong>is</strong> a reflection of the
stressful conditions on the team, and the act of applying pressure to the candidate is intentional, to measure
their ability to handle it. In either case, we don't feel like this is how we want to measure engineers; it just
doesn't reflect reality.</p>

<a name="Whiteboard.interviews"></a>
<h3>Whiteboard interviews</h3>

<p>One intention of whiteboard interviews is to reduce the stress on the candidate, because they don't have to worry
about code syntax while under a microscope. These types of interviews still lead to
<a href="https://code.dblock.org/2012/12/08/five-ways-to-torture-candidates-in-a-technical-interview.html">stressful conditions</a>,
though, and they don't provide a good measure of what makes a great teammate or even a great developer. Again,
sometimes the pressure is intentional, to see how the candidate reacts.</p>

<p>It can be very difficult to find a problem that is succinct enough for a whiteboard exercise but still reflective
of the work the candidate will actually be doing on the job. The ability to write an algorithm to search a binary
tree might be reflective of whether a candidate has a traditional Computer Science degree, but doesn't necessarily
speak to their ability to build complex interfaces or streamline performance. More importantly, whether or not they
can write a binary search tree from scratch on a whiteboard doesn't even necessarily speak to their ability to
<em>use</em> search trees in day-to-day work. Questions like this can eliminate excellent developers who took a
non-traditional approach to their knowledge building but are still highly capable.</p>

<a name="Sample.code"></a>
<h3>Sample code</h3>

<p>Sometimes a company will request a code sample from candidates - after all, what shows off their ability to code
better than their actual code? The downfall of this strategy is that it eliminates developers who don't have code
they can share. Many great engineers work for closed-source companies; many great engineers have family
responsibilities that prevent them from contributing to open-source at night.</p>

<p>It is also important to consider the insularity and biases that exist in the open source community that can make
contributing more difficult for developers from underrepresented groups. A study published in the PeerJ Computer
Science journal found that women’s contributions to open source projects were accepted more frequently than men’s
contributions when the gender of the contributor was unknown. However, when the gender of the contributor was
apparent, men's contributions were
<a href="https://code.likeagirl.io/gender-bias-in-open-source-d1deda7dec28">accepted more frequently than women's</a>.</p>

<a name="Take-home.challenges"></a>
<h3>Take-home challenges</h3>

<p>The most recent trend in hiring is the take-home exercise. The goal is honorable - have the candidate produce code
on their own time, so they aren't overwhelmed with the pressure of an audience. We’ve found that requiring this
early in the process is unfair, and including it later in the process is uninformative; by the time a take-home
challenge would be appropriate, we have already evaluated the candidate's technical skills to our satisfaction
(more on that later).</p>

<p>This strategy also assumes the candidate has time to work on homework. Many single parents do not for example, nor
do engineers who care for family members. There can also be misalignment on the expected time to complete a
take-home challenge. While the exercise might take a current engineer at the company 2 hours to complete, that
doesn't consider several factors: (1) a candidate might not be familiar with all technologies requested, and can
easily lose time to research and learning; (2) the candidate wants to look good, so they're likely to work longer
than you expect; and (3) the candidate might be interviewing for several companies at once, and have multiple
competing assignments to work on.</p>

<p>Many companies use take-home challenges early in the hiring process to shift the burden of evaluation from the
company on to the candidates themselves. This unfairly excludes lots of potentially amazing colleagues.</p>

<p><aside>
  <div class="question">
    <h3>Why do you think these kinds of bad hiring practices are so common in the tech industry? And what sets hiring practices in tech apart from hiring in other industries?</h3>
  </div>
    <div class="answer">
    <img src="/images/artsy-engineering-hiring/steve.jpg">
    <p class="intro">Steve Hicks says...</p>
    <p>We are very logical people in the tech industry. We want to create algorithms or heuristics for everything, including hiring. Using a yardstick like "Fizz Buzz" or trivia questions allows us to easily narrow down the candidate pool. It's a simple, intentional form of gate-keeping. The hiring algorithm is much easier to write when it's "Oh, you don't know what a closure is? Sorry, we're not interested." It's much harder to write a hiring algorithm that respects nuance: "well...it depends. Maybe you have different experiences than I do. It'll take some digging to find out if our experiences will complement each other."</p>
  </div>
  <div class="answer">
    <img src="/images/artsy-engineering-hiring/lily.jpg">
    <p class="intro">Lily Pace says...</p>
    <p>I think the tech industry has an elitism problem, and this is reflected in the way candidates are evaluated. There’s a general feeling in some parts of the industry that what we do is different and somehow elevated from other professions, that engineering is a skill that only a select few are capable of, not something that anyone can learn with the right training and enthusiasm. Making candidates go through a gauntlet of challenges during the interview process reinforces this idea.</p>

    <img src="/images/artsy-engineering-hiring/ash.jpg">
    <p class="intro">Ash Furrow says...</p>
    <p>I think when looking at the current state of the computer programming industry, and its hiring practices, we need to pay special attention to its history. The original computer programmers of the twentieth century were women, but they were <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/careers/2017/aug/10/how-the-tech-industry-wrote-women-out-of-history">systematically pushed out of the industry</a>. One way they were pushed out was through discriminatory hiring practices, especially interview questions and techniques specifically designed to exclude non-white, non-male applicants. Sadly, these hiring practices persist, even if their original motivations have been obscured by time.</p>

<a name="What.we.do.instead"></a>
<h2>What we do instead</h2>

<p>In addition to the above strategies not being fair, we've found that they measure things that are secondary to what
we're looking for.</p>

<p>Artsy is more complicated than FizzBuzz. Too complicated for any one engineer to build, in fact. Individual
engineers working alone can’t build the software Artsy needs to succeed – they must work together. So the skills we
evaluate for are things like empathy, communication, and kindness. Not that technical skills aren’t important, but
the ability to communicate and learn is more important.</p>

<p>Engineers who excel at empathy, communication, and kindness can pick up the technical stuff once they're hired;
personal and interpersonal skills are harder to teach. Adding a colleague to the team who lacks these skills could
harm the culture we've built.</p>

<p>When you interview with Artsy as an engineer, you won't just meet other engineers and a manager. You'll meet with
people from other departments too. If you're hired as an Artsy engineer, you're going to work with folks from all
across the company - we want to make sure you can communicate with them because that's something we do every day.</p>

    <h3>How has this impacted your day-to-day work at Artsy so far?</h3>

    <p class="intro">Lily Pace says...</p>
    <p>I had a negative experience in the past with a coworker who lacked empathy and boundaries and made me feel unwelcome and othered as the only woman on the team and someone from a non-traditional background. It made me afraid to ask for help and stifled my progress. This experience made me hesitant to open up to new coworkers, especially when I needed assistance. Because Artsy evaluates candidates based on empathy, communication, and kindness, I arrived with a <a href="https://medium.com/artsy-blog/what-it-feels-like-to-work-in-a-supportive-environment-for-female-engineers-3c994a001007">level of trust in my new coworkers</a> that usually takes weeks or months to develop. </p>

    <p>In most of my previous jobs, it's taken me a while to learn who I can be vulnerable around and who I can't. At Artsy I have quickly learned that I don't need to worry about it. I feel an incredible sense of psychological safety with the Artsy team. I can be vocal about not understanding something, and I can ask for help without feeling like a burden or fool.</p>

    <p>I'm a sensitive person. I don't like pointless or inflammatory conflict – I find it distracting and counterproductive. However, I can relax and let my guard down at Artsy. My sensitivity to how others are feeling is a part of my contributions to the team, and I'm able to fold the emotional wellbeing that <strong>I</strong> get from everyone back into our team: a sort of constantly-accelerating feedback loop of good feelings.</p>

<a name="But.we.still.evaluate.technical.aptitude"></a>
<h2>But we still evaluate technical aptitude</h2>

<p>Technical aptitude is less important to us than interpersonal skills, but it is still important. Note that we said
"aptitude," not "skills": we don't expect our engineers to already know everything about the tech stack we're
using. Instead, we expect them to have a strong ability to learn our stack and use it effectively once they have.
(This is touched on in our docs on
<a href="https://github.com/artsy/README/blob/master/careers/juniors.md">what we look for in junior engineers</a>.)</p>

<p>So if we skip all the usual tactics for evaluating technical aptitude, how do we do it? <strong>By talking to people</strong>.</p>

<p>We learn a lot about candidates in their interviews. We'll have a conversation with them about technology. Instead
of white-boarding, we ask them to describe what they like about their favorite library, or what they wish they
could change. We ask them to describe some legacy code they’ve worked with, and ask them how they think it got that
way. We’re looking for a mix of technical skills as well as empathy and an ability to communicate nuanced ideas.</p>

<a name="References.are.important.to.us"></a>
<h2>References are important to us</h2>

<p>We also learn a lot through reference checks. Our reference checks aren't simply validation of your employment
history - they are a 30 minute-long conversation with each of your three references that go into detail about your
work history and career growth. It's quite an in-depth conversation, with questions structured to dig into
specifics about the candidate's behavior.</p>

<p>An Artsy reference call might include the following structured questions:</p>

<blockquote><p>In your capacity as [relationship to the candidate], how many people have you worked with in the candidate's
role?</p>

<p>Okay, in <em>just</em> terms of job performance, how you rank the candidate out of that [X] many people?</p>

<p>Okay, finally, what's the difference between [the candidate's rank] and number one? How would the candidate need
to grow to get to number one?</p></blockquote>

<p>The first question establishes the context for the reference. The second question primes the reference to use that
context when answering the next question. The third question is what we're <em>actually</em> interested in. These aren't
easy or comfortable questions, but they give us an insight into the candidate's career, history, and areas to grow.</p>

<p>Fully half of our decision to make an offer or not is based on our reference checks. Artsy Engineering candidates
go through the same reference check process as anyone applying for a job at Artsy, with Engineers sitting in on the
call with Artsy's hiring staff.</p>

<a name="But.seriously..we.really.care.about.the.personal.side"></a>
<h3>But seriously, we really care about the personal side</h3>

<p>We also make sure every interview ends amicably. No candidate should feel bad after interviewing with Artsy, even
if we don't give them an offer. This seems self-evident to us, given our values, but it makes a lot of business
sense to maintain our reputation as an engineering team.</p>

<a name="Our.hiring.practice.philosophy"></a>
<h2>Our hiring practice philosophy</h2>

<p>One of our core values at Artsy is that
<a href="https://github.com/artsy/README/blob/master/culture/what-is-artsy.md#people-are-paramount">People Are Paramount</a>.
We like to think that our interview process was built to reflect this.</p>

<p>We see the interview process as an opportunity to build a relationship with a candidate. We talk to them to find
out if they're a good fit for Artsy, and we help them decide if Artsy is a good fit for them. Our hiring process
focuses more on human skills than most processes do. It's not perfect, but it has served us well.</p>

  <div class="question">
    <h3>Where do you still think Artsy has to grow, in terms of how it hires engineers?</h3>
  </div>
  <div class="answer">
    <img src="/images/artsy-engineering-hiring/lily.jpg">
    <p class="intro">Lily Pace says...</p>
    <p>I think Artsy is really unique and innovative in how it evaluates candidates and I think the more we can express this in our job postings the better. Stressing alignment with our values and an ability to learn and posting fewer hard requirements are some simple ways to convey to potential applicants that we evaluate differently.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="answer">
    <img src="/images/artsy-engineering-hiring/ash.jpg">
    <p class="intro">Ash Furrow says...</p>
    <p>I think one area we've historically struggled with, and still do, is sourcing candidates from a wide range of backgrounds. Artsy Engineering's hiring pool still draws heavily from the professional networks of existing Artsy staff; while this has a lot of benefits, it also has the potential to exclude groups who aren't already represented on our team.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="answer">
    <img src="/images/artsy-engineering-hiring/steve.jpg">
    <p class="intro">Steve Hicks says...</p>
    <p>I agree with Ash. I think all companies hire based on their employees' networks, because that's the easiest way to find people. <a href="https://twitter.com/seldo/">Laurie Voss</a> talked about this recently on <a href="https://reactpodcast.simplecast.fm/33">the React Podcast</a>. He pointed out that diversity at NPM has been better than average since the company started; and that the ratios of diversity have been consistent from the beginning, as a result of hiring from their own networks. I'd love to see Artsy hire beyond our networks (and as a result expand our networks).</p>
  </div>
</aside></p>

<p>Our hiring process will never be "finished" because we're always improving on it. Some recent improvements are
inward-facing to help <em>us</em> get better, like:</p>

<ul>
<li>Starting a #dev-ersity Slack channel for talking about how to diversify our team and the industry at large.</li>
<li>Integrating hiring updates into our weekly standup.</li>
<li>Creating a Slack bot for engineers to monitor our hiring pipeline.</li>
<li>Periodically rotating hiring managers to spread institutional knowledge and get new perspectives.</li>
<li>Many, many docs written on guiding the process.</li>
</ul>


<p>Artsy engineers, guided by our company values, created the hiring process for new engineers. Combined with an
iterative process and a desire to constantly improve, we've created a hiring process that is fair, effective, and
respectful. This kind of engineering-led approach is gaining popularity; for example, Microsoft recently
<a href="https://blog.usejournal.com/rethinking-how-we-interview-in-microsofts-developer-division-8f404cfd075a">revamped its hiring process</a>
with this approach.</p>

<p>We hope this catches on.</p>

<p>So what can <em>you</em> do? A great first step is to send this post to your HR rep. Another great step is to open source
your hiring documentation; you'd be surprised how motivating this can be, and it's a great opportunity to get
feedback from other companies. Leave a comment below, let's brainstorm on other ways to improve the state of hiring
in software engineering!</p>

<p>And remember: while <em>you</em> might be motivated based on what feels "right", businesses are motivated by bottom lines.
Fortunately for us, the evidence is on our side: this is a better way to hire, for everyone.</p>
